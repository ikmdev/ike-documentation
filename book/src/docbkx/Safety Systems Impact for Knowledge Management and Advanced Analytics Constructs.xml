    <title>Patient Safety Overview</title><?oxy_comment_end?>
    <para>Integrated Knowledge Exchange (IKE) is a set of principles, tools and methods that are
        designed to make doing the right thing easier. One of those “right things” is patient
        safety. First and foremost, our health information must do no harm to the patient. IKE
        enables more accurate, complete, precise, and higher-quality health data that is safer to
        use for clinical decision-making as low-quality health data management practices can lead to
        under treatment, over treatment, or delayed treatment resulting in preventable patient harm.

        <title>Patient Safety – Then and Now</title>
        <para>Patient safety has been defined as the “prevention of harm to patients” [2]. To
            achieve patient safety, the whole healthcare system must work collaboratively to prevent
            errors, learn from the errors that occur, and develop a culture of safety similar to
            other high-risk industries, such as aviation.</para>
        <para>Previously, patient safety efforts have primarily focused on investigating adverse
            events <emphasis role="italic">after</emphasis> they have occurred. This is known as
                <emphasis role="bold">reactive safety</emphasis> and, while important for learning
            from errors, is insufficient in reducing common adverse events. such as medication
            errors, surgical complications, or diagnostic errors [2]. Alternatively, <emphasis
                role="bold">proactive safety</emphasis> attempts to design or redesign systems,
            processes, and methods based on leading indicators of increased risk, poor quality, or
            identified flaws <emphasis role="italic">before</emphasis> an adverse event occurs.
            Examples of proactive safety practices include hazard analysis, safety reporting,
            audits, tracers, training, testing, and surveys to measure the culture of safety.</para>
        <para>Properly implementing both reactive and proactive safety requires organizations and
            systems to develop a <emphasis role="bold">culture of safety</emphasis> that establishes
            a non-punitive response to error, also known as a “just culture". Just culture is a
            balance between learning from error and accountability that encourages practitioners to
            be transparent with the self-reporting of errors by reducing or eliminating the fear of
            retribution, loss of employment, or legal action [3]. Blaming an individual or team for
            system errors prevents learning from errors, impedes continuous improvement, and
            reinforces silence when system vulnerabilities are discovered. Unfortunately, many
            current healthcare professionals continue to be hesitant when reporting errors due to
            medical malpractice litigation concerns and threat of employment termination.</para>
        <para>Since the 1999 report, <emphasis role="italic">To Err is Human</emphasis>, was
            published by the Institute of Medicine, patient safety has received more attention
            across the healthcare ecosystem due to the prevalence of preventable patient harm. A
            short review of these important patient safety publications documents key milestones for
            system improvement opportunities and required changes to improve patient care and
            safety:</para>

                    breadth and depth of preventable harm that estimated nearly 100,000 Americans
                    died because of preventable patient harm and the challenge of improving patient
                    safety [4]. In 2016, a study from Johns Hopkins researchers estimated annual
                    patient deaths at more than 250,000 Americans making preventable patient harm
                    the third leading cause of death in the United States of America (USA) behind
                    cardiac disease and cancer [5].</para>

                    major healthcare quality gaps, how current practices degrade the quality of
                    healthcare in America, and how to take systems approaches to improve the quality
                    of care delivered to patients. The paper outlines goals for healthcare quality
                    improvements, including redesigning safety as system property, improving
                    effectiveness, focusing on patient-centered approaches, timeliness and
                    efficiency, and more. The report also furthered the need for digitized health
                    information systems [6].</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Health IT and Patient Safety (2012)</emphasis> –
                    described both the promise of health information technology (HIT) and the
                    potential patient safety risks of poorly designed, improperly configured, and
                    mismanaged electronic patient data and HIT systems. The report further
                    highlighted the importance of the human-machine (including software) interfaces
                    to prevent diagnostic errors and improve clinical decision making. HIT vendors,
                    regulators, and health systems were encouraged to find ways to mitigate
                    identified HIT risks and the unintended consequences of the Meaningful Use
                    criteria as part of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical

                <para><emphasis role="bold">Improving Diagnosis in Health Care (2015)</emphasis> –
                    described the importance of reducing the prevalence of diagnostic errors across
                    the healthcare system including missed diagnoses, delayed diagnoses, and
                    incorrect diagnoses resulting in undertreatment, overtreatment, suboptimal
                    standard of care, and preventable patient harm. It is estimated that every
                    American will experience at least one diagnostic error during their lifetime.
                    High quality health information is critical for improving diagnostic decision
                    making and clinicians and patients must be able to trust the underlying health

            <title>High Reliability Organizations (HROs)</title>
            <para>High reliability organization (HRO) principles from other safety critical
                industries, such as commercial aviation and nuclear power, began to be adopted as a
                patient safety framework in some healthcare settings. [10] These principles,
                outlined in the table below, originated from social science as behaviors present in
                organizations that operate in extremely complex, high-risk environments with high
                levels of system reliability believed to produce safer outcomes. Reliability is the
                probability that a component or system will perform as designed under certain
                conditions over time (i.e., checklists). </para>

            <para>While leaders and managers can foster a culture supported by HRO principles, HRO
                methods rely on decomposition or breaking complex systems down into single
                components to analyze. If they primarily focus on reducing errors at a single
                component level, also known as component failures (human or machine), they can be
                erroneously made to believe that worse case scenarios (losses, adverse events, and
                accidents) have linear causality with the human as a possible weak link in the
                system.</para>
            <para>Traditional safety approaches are inadequate when it comes to addressing the
                increasing complexity in the healthcare ecosystem. Methodologies, like root cause
                analysis (RCA) and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), focus on failures at a
                component level or as over-simplified human error and were developed before work
                systems incorporated software, computers, and other sophisticated technology such as
                artificial intelligence (AI). The healthcare ecosystem is complex, multifaceted, and
                highly coupled across various systems, such as healthcare data information systems,
                and requires a more complex and comprehensive approach to safety that employs
                systems theory, systems thinking, and a systems approach to safety [11,12].</para>

            <title>System Safety</title>
            <para>System Safety is rooted in systems theory where the whole system is more than the
                sum of the parts. System Safety addresses the whole using a combination of systems
                and safety engineering approaches and views patient safety as a control problem. </para>
            <para>Engineering models can be developed and analyzed for safety and quality purposes
                throughout the system’s lifecycle from design through adoption. These system models
                are <emphasis role="italic">not</emphasis> schematics or flow charts; instead, they
                serve as abstract representations of highly complex sociotechnical relationships
                between a controller and the process being controlled. These relationships are known
                as control loops (Figure 1) [13].</para>

                process in this example. The downward arrows represent the control actions that the
                controller uses to control the patient care process including assessments, exams,
                tests, imaging, treatments, and therapies. The upward arrows are feedback mechanisms
                the provider receives from the patient such as their medical history, symptoms, and
                health trends. </para>
            <para>Without adequate feedback, the provider would not be able to make safe, high
                quality clinical decisions that meet the standard of care. The <emphasis
                    role="italic">Provider</emphasis> controller develops a process model or belief
                system about each individual patient before making treatment decisions. Other
                information may be accessible through the patient’s electronic health record (EHR),
                a family member, or another patient advocate. Modelling the patient care system of
                interest builds on this control loop to include other essential control loops
                forming what’s known as a control structure [14].</para>
            <para>Once the control structure is fully modelled, either in the design or redesign
                phases of the system lifecycle, teams can conduct proactive and retrospective safety
                analyses to identify new requirements, system hazards, unsafe control actions, and
                missing feedback loops. The System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) method is most
                effective when used early in the design or redesign phase as a prospective safety
                analysis while the Causal Analysis based on Systems Theory (CAST) is used
                retrospectively to determine causal factors of adverse events such as preventable
                patient harm [15].</para>

            <title>Safety Management</title>
            <para>Safety Management Systems (SMS)are used by high-risk industries such as aviation,
                military commands, health care, and nuclear power to reduce or eliminate hazards for
                safer outcomes. SMS is a formalized approach to safety decision-making, proactive
                safety management, safety culture promotion, and quality assurance. An effective SMS
                relies on a comprehensive safety information system that has leading indicators of
                safe performance, feedback from voluntary reporting, and passive data collection
                using software applications that monitor system control actions. </para>
            <para>Safety data trends are reported to responsible parties including operators,
                supervisors, management, regulators, and other industry stakeholders. An SMS is an
                enabler for learning including knowledge sharing, policy effectiveness, and
                innovation and drives key processes like safety risk management and safety assurance
                [16]. SMS design is enhanced when system control structures are modelled, monitored,
                and audited using system safety engineering principles such as STPA to support
                continual process improvement.</para>
            <para>Safety in a health data context includes clinical decision support, safe data
                exchange, and safe use of health data for regulatory oversight, health equity,
                research, and population health decision-making. Furthermore, poor data quality
                degrades patient safety especially among disparate health populations when using low
                quality data to train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for patient care

                <para>This following UCA scenario identifies an area within the Spotlight Case Study
                    #1 where IKE solutioning would strengthen knowledge representation, improve data
                    quality, and reduce patient risk.</para>
                <para>UCA scenario: A medical practitioner may provide treatment that does not match
                    the patient’s condition. One contributing factor may be that the practitioner
                    did not have the diagnostic information to inform their mental model of the
                    patient’s condition. The diagnostic information may not be observed by the
                    medical practitioner because they may be accustomed to using their routine
                    process to access results in the EHR, which only displays laboratory data that
                    has been previously mapped to the care facility’s EHR system (e.g., mapped to a
                    LOINC® code or local code representation). In some cases, additional unmapped
                    test results are shared by the laboratory as a Portable Document Format (PDF)
                    and the physician may not notice the PDF due to its lack of salience in the EHR
                    process flow. Physicians who are not expecting and looking for the test results
                    may not be prompted to look for additional, unmapped information in a patient
                    profile, particularly if the unmapped results were ordered by another physician
                    or a long time ago. The results may have been shared as a PDF because they
                    pertained to a new or uncommon test whose format could not be represented in the
                    messaging standard available to that laboratory-care facility pair. Standards
                    for new and complex tests (e.g., genomics) are not yet tightly constrained,
                    which means the results can be shared as PDFs because Clinical Laboratory
                    Improvement Amendments (CLIA) only requires that the data that is sent gets
                    received and does not specify the method of transmission nor impose any
                    requirement or confirmation that the information is observed by the medical
                    practitioner. CLIA was drafted and approved in 1988, before EHRs were widely
                    adopted and modifications to CLIA require Congressional approval. The following
                    is a visualization of this scenario using system safety principles.</para>

        <title>The Promise of Digital Health Information and Patient Safety</title>
        <para>Moving from paper charts to EHR systems is mostly complete (96%) in hospitals in the
            U.S., while 22% of office-based physician practices remain paper-based [18]. Incentive
            programs such as the <emphasis role="italic">Meaningful Use </emphasis>(MU) program
            provided government funding through the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services
            (CMS) for health systems and provider organizations to digitize their health information
            systems. From 2010-2020, MU program goals included digital data collection, data
            sharing, advanced clinical processes, and improved outcomes. Studies have shown that HIT
            has improved patient safety by reducing medication errors, avoiding adverse drug
            reactions, and increasing adherence to evidence-based medicine protocols [19].</para>
        <para>While HIT has improved some clinical outcomes, the adoption, configuration,
            implementation, and maintenance of HIT has increased patient risk in other parts of the
            health delivery system due to unintended consequences of poorly managed systems [20].
            First-generation HIT configurations have mostly been managed by HIT vendors who mainly
            focused on billing data and other administrative and operational data management
            functions (e.g., reimbursement, mandatory reporting, etc.). HIT adoption radically
            changed historic clinical workflows in an effort to standardize data inputs and system
            outputs, but this “one size fits all” approach was resisted by clinicians creating
            configuration trade-offs, workarounds, and increased system complexity. </para>
        <para>Local configurations and local coding created unique HIT features and functionality,
            which may have been needed based on hospital location or patient population, also
            created variability from hospital to hospital even within the same health network. For
            the most part, these local variations had few <emphasis role="italic">visible</emphasis>
            negative consequences for patients and health practitioners. Unfortunately, most HIT
            configurations did not optimize for patient mobility – patients who received care in
            non-affiliated systems or for the need to share precise data with other health systems,
            health registries, and public health agencies.</para>
        <para>Without new incentives, many organizations are unable to fully maintain their HIT as
            vendor maintenance contract costs continue to increase. Experienced HIT personnel have
            also become more expensive as technology companies search for qualified staff in a
            decreasing talent pool, which has led Health systems to be more dependent on vendors to
            fill the talent gap. Some under-resourced hospitals may be forced to delay system
            upgrades and updates – even important changes in terminology, clinical workflows, naming
            and coding, or other critical data quality enhancements due to concerns over system
            failures, outages, or unexpected consequences from system updates. These are real
            concerns and may lead to patient safety implications. The recent CrowdStrike
            cybersecurity update failure in 2024 caused many health systems to cancel surgeries and
            other non-critical services leading to over $2 billion in losses to healthcare
            organizations [21].</para>
        <section>
            <title>Addressing Patient Safety Gaps in the Current Health Data Ecosystem</title>
            <para>Health data is a critical component of health care decisions and can directly
                impact the treatment that patients receive, and the quality of care delivered.
                Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) depend on accurate and precise data to
                ensure decision “triggers” fire when appropriate to prevent delays in treatment or
                diagnostic errors. If important clinical information is missing sufficient context,
                decision-making can be incorrect, insufficient, or incomplete. A laboratory test
                result that is missing units of measure, reference range, or unique device
                identification may be excluded from a providers decision-making process for a
                patient, which may then prompt further testing, additional costs, and unnecessary
                patient suffering through intrusive tests. Patient history may not always be
                accurate or complete – especially when limiting data migration to a patient’s recent
                history or when sharing data from one EHR to another.</para>
            <para>Many of the errors related to encoding, sharing, and exchanging health data remain
                difficult to manage safely since institutions are mostly interested in the quality
                of the data received rather than the data sent. ASTP/ONC has developed the Trusted
                Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) to enhance data sharing and data
                exchange by establishing policies, governance practices, and standards aimed at
                making health data more accessible for payers, public health agencies, provider
                organizations, and patients. TEFCA will likely enhance the data sharing
                infrastructure, but it still does not currently address the quality of data being
                shared [22].</para>
            <para>Data intended to be used for research needs to possess the attributes summarized
                in the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) Guiding
                Principles, which provide guidelines to make data findable (F), accessible (A),
                interoperable (I), and reusable (R) to the research community and machines.
                Unfortunately, a large portion of health data does not meet the FAIR Guiding
                Principles as it is often hidden in isolated data silos or incompatible systems and
                difficult to exchange, process, and interpret [23,24]. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
                leaders were unable to make informed decisions related to public health because of
                incomplete data, unstructured data, and missing data leading to preventable patient
                deaths, pandemic response delays, and unnecessary lockdowns [25].</para>

            <title>Spotlight Case Study #2: Interoperability and Patient Safety – A Case for a
                Source of Truth</title>
            <para>A source of truth, or definitive knowledge source, is needed to ensure data is
                accurate and trustworthy from the time it is encoded at the source, during
                validation, and as it is transmitted within and between HIT systems. Trustworthy
                data in turn ensures that safety management systems can operate properly and
                accurately, and governing bodies are able to rely on data and audits of appropriate
                controls to provide real time feedback.</para>
            <para>While there are multiple health data standards development and oversight
                organizations that look to act as a source of truth, each of these organizations
                have their own “standards” and lack a unifying knowledge source. Simply put, one
                patient safety use case for IKE, is the ability to identify a singular source of
                data truth that can branch across multiple organizational standards and can be
                edited or updated by a unified governing entity as new testing, devices, patient
                conditions or disease codes are discovered. Thus, as changes occur the uniform
                dictionary is updated and rapidly distributed across the healthcare ecosystem before
                preventable patient harm occurs due to missed, delayed, or incorrect
                diagnoses.</para>
            <para>Having an independent governance process and entity provides a singular,
                collaborative voice for data dictionary maintenance and development that represents
                input from not only healthcare providers, but laboratories, regulatory bodies, and
                device manufactures. In addition to defining and codifying health care information
                in an objective manner, this governing body would allow for auditing of current
                dictionary definitions to assure accuracy and consistency across the ecosystem and
                improve the safety and interoperability of data. The use of this dictionary must be
                mandatory to prevent variation and allow for concurrent audit tools that can be used
                to drive continuous process improvement. Another benefit of a rigorous governing
                body is that institutional history is maintained through a transparent manner (e.g.,
                data provenance) for future use and reference as changes need to be made or new
                definitions are required, even as potential turnover within the governance body
                occurs. </para>
            <para>Using IKE as a source of truth for health care data within the healthcare
                ecosystem will provide uniformity, consistency, and accuracy in a standardized
                format that will reduce patient harm and enhance the accuracy of clinical
                decision-making. Watch the full case study <link

                codes, were compared in the following: between sending and receiving EHR systems,
                the individual Health Level Seven International (HL7) Version 2 messages across the
                instrument, laboratory information system, and the sending EHR. The analysis found
                that the loss of information for this and similar tests indicated the following

            <para>This analysis showcased the challenges surrounding the completeness and accuracy
                of laboratory data exchanges in terms of the data elements required by law and the
                needed details to correctly interpret the results of the test. Additionally, this
                analysis highlighted the differences of manufacturers’ equipment (specifically in
                vitro devices) performing the same test on the same sample and the production of
                differing results. Furthermore, despite being essential for correct interpretation,
                information on the equipment manufacturer that produced the result, and the type of
                sample tested was never included in the exchange results. The study concluded that
                while the Systemic Harmonization and Interoperability Enhancement for Laboratory
                Data (SHIELD) collaborative community recommendations can be helpful − such as
                consistently including encodement information (SNOMED CT® and LOINC®), UCUM (Unified
                Codes for Units of Measure), and Unique Device Identifier (UDI) – these are partial
                steps to improving laboratory data interoperability. In tandem, EHR and Laboratory
                Information System (LIS) functionality must be standardized to allow for the
                consistent capture and transmission of relevant data elements. Usage of a HIE with
                standard messaging, SHIELD recommendations, and enhanced EHR data encoding
                functionality can yield consistent test identification and result value
                transmission. </para>

            <title>Spotlight Case Study #5: Establishing Trust in Pharmaceutical Data with an
                Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) Methodology</title>
            <para>In this study, researchers demonstrated a general-purpose IV&amp;V approach for
                information models, instance data, and knowledge that will enable reproducible
                metrics for data quality and patient safety. This IV&amp;V approach uses established
                statistical process control methods for inter-rater and intra-rater reliability and
                agreement metrics with Cohen’s Kappa to evaluate pharmacy prescription data being
                migrated between a legacy EHR and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) EHR. These methods
                are widely accepted in other industries where quality and safety are closely
                monitored, but the methods are under-utilized within the HIT industry. The research
                team demonstrated that these methods can be applied to electronic health data and
                knowledge management tasks. Researchers recommended that HIT practitioners routinely
                use bivariate comparison of reviewer agreement over an appropriately sized
                statistical sample to develop standard benchmarks for health data and knowledge
                quality and safety. A detailed description of the method is provided in this study
                along with summarized analysis findings from the application of IV&amp;V methods to
                pharmacy prescription data being migrated between EHRs.</para>

        <title>Summary</title>
        <para>Many other safety-critical industries are addressing the data quality of their safety
            information to improve safety management of their aircraft, automobiles, power plants,
            and search engines. In today’s digital healthcare ecosystem and with patients receiving
            care in diverse health settings, even at home, patient safety does not just depend upon
            highly skilled clinicians. Now, more than ever, patient safety depends on high quality
            data. Producing high quality data depends on ensuring data is accurately encoded at the
            source and exchanged or migrated without losing meaningful context for clinical decision
            making no matter where a patient receives treatment. Health informaticists and HIT
            professionals need tooling and support to ensure their organizations are producing high
            data quality. IKE can provide this tooling and support to improve health data quality so
            providers, leaders, and patients can trust their health data is safe to use.</para>
