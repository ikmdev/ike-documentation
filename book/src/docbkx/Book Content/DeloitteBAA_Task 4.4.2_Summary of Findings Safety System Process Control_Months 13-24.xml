        <title>Purpose</title>
        <para>The goal of this paper is to document the standard operating procedures used when
            transforming a new knowledge standard. This includes how the transformation is completed
            and released for Systemic Harmonization and Interoperability Enhancement for Laboratory
            Data (SHIELD) Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) reference implementation. By
            comprehensively testing and documenting the transformation process, inadequacies and
            gaps in laboratory data standards can better be addressed to maintain systems
            safety.</para>
        <para>Additionally, this paper will demonstrate the transformations and findings. It will
            provide an analysis of how future transformations can improve standards, ensuring that
            our systems remain robust, reliable, and capable of meeting evolving data requirements.
            Through this documentation, we aim to establish a clear and consistent framework for
            data transformations that supports ongoing improvements in laboratory data standards and
            system safety.</para>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Over the past year, we have identified several issues within our data transformation
            processes that have impacted the accuracy and reliability of our systems. To address
            these challenges and enhance overall system safety, we made the strategic decision to
            automate the data transformation process. Automation offers significant advantages,
            including improved consistency, accuracy, and efficiency, which are critical for
            maintaining high safety standards.</para>
        <para>By automating integration testing, we can quickly verify the integrity of data
            transformations, ensuring that any potential issues are detected and resolved promptly.
            The automated pipeline we implemented has already demonstrated its value by enabling
            efficient processing of larger datasets, such as the latest Systematized Nomenclature of
            Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) international origin data, and identifying
            inefficiencies within our internal processes. This capability not only enhances our
            efficiency but also ensures that our systems can scale effectively to handle increasing
            data volumes.</para>
        <para>Furthermore, automation provides continuous monitoring and generates detailed
            documentation, which are essential for auditing, compliance, and maintaining high safety
            standards. By standardizing our procedures and protocols through automation, we ensure
            that all safety measures are applied uniformly, thereby enhancing the overall
            reliability of our systems.</para>

        <title>Methodology</title>
        <para>The following sections will delve into various knowledge standards as examples,
            illustrating the data transformation process to achieve "tinkarization." Alongside the
            initial steps, we have implemented testing methods and quality assurance processes to
            ensure data integrity validation. Ultimately, these methods define the standard
            operating procedure for representing a new knowledge standard and illustrate how these
            steps enhance system safety. </para>

            <title>Develop Knowledge Resource Patterns</title>
            <para>A template for defining patterns for new knowledge resources was developed using
                Excel. This template includes essential data types, meanings, and purposes for each
                pattern to be represented in the Terminology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar) Schema.
                It enables consistent encoding and future management of these values, while also
                preventing duplication by utilizing Komet for their generation. Subject matter
                experts must reach a consensus on the meaning and purpose of each element within
                both the fields and the pattern itself. This agreement ensures process control as
                the data is utilized across various systems.</para>
            <para>Figure 1 below illustrates how a pattern is defined in the Tinkar Data, as shown
                through the Komet reference implementation.</para>

            <title>Data Pipeline Architecture</title>
            <para>In order to standardize and create an efficient way of “tinkarizing” new knowledge
                standards, the team developed a data pipeline that utilizes Maven and GitHub (Figure
                2). The pipeline can be broken down into the following phases.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Setup</title>
                <para>Before the pipeline is executed there are several setup plugins and processes
                    that are performed for each standard. These plugins and processes are tailored
                    specifically to the design and desired transformation outcome of each standard
                    respectively. The first and most important process is to identify all necessary
                    versions of artifacts that will be used within the lifecycle of the pipeline. In
                    Figure 2, this is called the Pipeline properties, which is a properties file
                    elaborating all details necessary for the pipeline to reproducibly be run. The
                    goal is that the same inputs to the pipeline will provide the same outputs each
                    time, this is known as an Idempotent process, which is ideal for having high
                    quality safe health systems.</para>
                <para>Additionally, the standard’s “raw” source data (generally in a zip format)
                    will be processed to extract relevant data and repackaged into what is called an
                    Origin file. This both standardizes how a pipeline represents data from a
                    standard, but also enable said data to be more accommodating for further
                    processing and transformations.</para>
                <para>Finally, starter data is generated, either from the IKM-based knowledge
                    editing application Komet or the appropriate Tinkar Application Programming
                    Interface (API). This starter data is packaged using our Google Protocol Buffers
                    file format and zipped up for distribution and retrieval within the pipeline.
                    Additionally, the starter data will have a Java (.jar) file generated containing
                    Java fields that represent all elements within the starter data file. This is
                    known as a “binding” and helps to ensure compile time compliance when developing
                    any Tinkar-based transformation processes. </para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Transformation</title>
                <para>Directly following the setup processes and plugin executions is the
                    transformation stage of the IKM pipeline. All transformation processes are
                    executed from a standard specific Maven plugin, which focuses on correctly
                    extracting, transforming, and loading origin data (from the origin file) into a
                    Tinkar-compliant database. All previous configurations and origin file processes
                    are applied to this transformation plugin and all transformation specific
                    configuration is further defined and controlled by appropriate Maven Project
                    Object Model (POM) files. This further enables the pipeline to build on the idea
                    of idempotency, which was established at the beginning of the setup
                    phase.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Post-Processing</title>
                <para>Once the transformation stage and its associated Maven transformation plugin
                    have been successfully completed, additional optional Maven plugins can be
                    integrated into the pipeline. These plugins further process the now Tinkarized
                    origin data, enhancing the overall data transformation workflow. These optional
                    plugins include the Web Ontology Language (OWL) transformation plugin, which
                    adapts the OWL syntax data into a logical structure suitable for advanced
                    reasoning and semantic processing, and the IKM Reasoner plugin, which applies
                    logical inferences to the transformed data to ensure consistency and semantic
                    accuracy.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Testing</title>
                <para>Finally, Maven executed integration tests are ran to verify that the generated
                    data integrates correctly with other systems and contains the expected
                    terminology from the origin. These tests ensure the overall integrity and
                    reliability of the data, confirming that all components and transformations work
                    together seamlessly. This comprehensive and systematic approach ensures that the
                    data is accurately prepared, transformed, and validated for subsequent
                    use.</para>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Starter Data</title>
            <para>Starter data is developed from a subset of concepts, definitions, synonyms, and
                navigation semantics specific to the knowledge standard undergoing transformation.
                These concepts are meticulously crafted to accurately Tinkarize the knowledge
                standard data. This process is currently facilitated by the Tinkar-data Maven
                pipeline architecture, which provides users with an automated method to generate
                Tinkarized starter data using a single Maven command.</para>
            <para>Figure 3 below illustrates a subset of SNOMED CT – Logical Observation
                Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC) starter data concepts. Certain knowledge
                standards may require additional starter data that can be Tinkarized using
                alternative Maven pipeline architectures, such as those provided for SNOMED CT or
                LOINC. These architectures utilize the defined concepts to generate the necessary
                classes. Should additional data need to be captured, the design document should be
                consulted to ascertain whether similar starter data already exists that can be
                utilized. If no such data exists, modifications to the starter data should be made
                in consultation with subject matter experts to ensure accuracy and
                consistency.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Data Parsing</title>
            <para>Data parsing involves processing the knowledge standard data files, a crucial step
                in the data transformation process. Depending on the format of the origin files, the
                data is parsed for specific syntax, which organizes the data to be programmatically
                accessible. After reviewing the specifications for the knowledge standard to
                understand its logical and physical models, it can be mapped to our logical model
                and stored in our physical model.</para>
            <para>For SNOMED CT, this entails understanding the various origin files, their formats,
                and the OWL syntax they utilize, followed by parsing the data accordingly. By
                thoroughly comprehending the parsable representation of the knowledge standard,
                developers can minimize risks associated with data parsing, ensuring accurate data
                representation and robust transformation and reasoning.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Data Transformation</title>
            <para>From the parsed data, the information is transformed into entities and Tinkarized,
                enabling the data to be viewable and navigable in Komet. For example, with SNOMED
                CT, each origin file undergoes the Tinkarization process, resulting in entities for
                concepts, descriptions, text definitions, OWL expressions, and language. These
                entities are then compiled into a single file that is consumable in Komet. This step
                is crucial not only to prevent the loss of meaning but also to provide an
                opportunity for the addition of further semantic information. In the case of LOINC,
                additional axiom semantic data can be incorporated during the transformation,
                allowing the data to be reasoned and ensuring a minimum level of navigable
                data.</para>
            <para>Figure 4 details the interaction between the Minimum Navigable Data, which focuses
                on the process and elements involved in navigation and reasoning, and the Minimum
                Viewable Data, which emphasizes the descriptions and identifiers necessary for
                viewing data. Further sections will elaborate on the specific roles and interactions
                of these components, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data flow and
                relationships depicted.</para>

            <para>Once the data has been Tinkarized, it can then be imported into Komet. This allows
                the transformed knowledge standard to be viewable in the concept panel of Komet.
                From there, the concepts, Status, Time, Author, Module and Path (STAMPS),
                descriptions, states, etc., are available to the user. This defines the minimum
                viewable data for the knowledge standard. Building a strong foundation with the
                pattern development is critical to making sure the data accurately displays in the
                Komet User Interface (UI). </para>

            <title>Minimum Navigable Data</title>
            <para>To see the minimum navigable data, the OWL transformation and Reasoner must be
                run. First, the OWL transformation is run which takes the axiom syntax from the
                transformation and creates the stated axioms and stated navigation. From there the
                Reasoner can be run, which takes the stated axioms and produces the inferred axioms
                and inferred navigation. At that point, the user can navigate the transformed data
                in Komet in the concept navigator and see any relationship origins or destinations.
                The ability to use the Maven pipeline gives the user the flexibility to take any
                SNOMED CT, SNOMED CT- LOINC or LOINC origin data and generate all the minimum
                navigable data in one step. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Integration Testing</title>
            <para>Integration testing is conducted once the transformation is complete. This process
                involves generating a protobuf file of the transformation and re-importing it back
                into the system. Counts of concepts, patterns, and semantics are taken prior to the
                export and compared to the counts once the data is re-imported. Additionally, data
                values are compared post-import to the original data source to validate accuracy.
                This can be achieved by comparing a list of complex concepts to the SNOMED CT
                browser and against the transformed and viewable concepts in the Komet UI. Any
                discrepancies are investigated, and the root cause is identified and documented,
                enhancing the safety and reliability of our systems.</para>
            <para>Over the past year, we have significantly expanded our integration testing
                procedures to address the issues identified in our data transformation processes. We
                have increased the scope of our integration tests to provide consistency across data
                sets and standardize our practices. This expansion ensures that tests go through
                both raw data and the outputted datastore, offering a wide breadth of testing to
                ensure completeness and accuracy. Importantly, these tests are transformation
                agnostic, meaning they can be applied to any data transformation process without
                modification. We also implemented an automated testing framework that continuously
                runs integration tests as part of our development and deployment pipeline. This
                automation ensures that tests are consistently executed, reducing the risk of human
                error and increasing the reliability of our testing processes. Enhanced monitoring
                and reporting capabilities have been integrated into our testing framework, allowing
                for real-time detection of issues and immediate feedback on test results, enabling
                quicker identification and resolution of potential problems. Additionally, we have
                incorporated regression testing to ensure that new changes do not negatively impact
                existing functionalities, helping maintain the stability and reliability of our
                systems as we introduce new features and improvements.</para>
            <para>Currently, IT implementations utilize the Maven-failsafe-plugin version 3.5.2,
                which focuses on the execution of integration tests and verifies their successful
                execution during the building and compilation of the repository. Common integration
                tests for any repository include IdentifierSemanticIT, DefinitionSemanticIT,
                DescriptionSemanticIT, ConceptSemanticIT, and AxiomSemanticIT.</para>
            <para>The expanded integration tests and the implementation of an automated testing
                framework have significantly improved system safety in several ways. By increasing
                test coverage and automating the testing process, we can detect issues early in the
                development cycle. This proactive approach allows us to address potential problems
                before they escalate, reducing the risk of system failures. Furthermore, integration
                tests are executed consistently and accurately, eliminating the variability
                associated with manual testing. This consistency enhances the reliability of our
                testing processes and the overall safety of our systems. Automated testing minimizes
                the risk of human error, which is a common source of issues in manual testing
                processes. By relying on automated tests, we can ensure that all scenarios are
                thoroughly tested without oversight. Real-time monitoring and reporting enable
                quicker identification and resolution of issues, which is crucial for maintaining
                system safety and preventing potential disruptions. Regression testing ensures that
                new changes do not introduce new issues or negatively impact existing
                functionalities, helping maintain the stability and reliability of our systems, even
                as we continue to evolve and improve them. The end-product is better after being
                more thoroughly tested, as more tests provide faster and earlier detection of bugs,
                ensuring that the final output is of higher quality and reliability.</para>
            <para>In summary, the expanded integration tests and automated testing framework have
                significantly enhanced our ability to maintain high safety standards. These
                improvements ensure that our data transformation processes are robust, reliable, and
                capable of supporting the ongoing needs of our systems.</para>

        <title>Findings</title>
        <para>In this section, we will highlight the key insights and areas where systems can be
            implemented to streamline the data transformation process and ensure robust testing
            mechanisms. We will also explore the implications of these implementations for system
            safety and knowledge management, with the goal of establishing a strong foundation for
            interoperable data. By focusing on the integration of advanced technologies and
            methodologies, we aim to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of data
            transformations. This approach not only mitigates potential risks but also promotes a
            cohesive and comprehensive framework for managing and utilizing data across various
            platforms and applications.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Automated Quality Assurance</title>
            <para>Through the transformation process, a key finding was the necessity for an
                automated and robust process to ensure data quality by conducting end-to-end
                testing. Previously, manual validation of data was performed by comparing the source
                of truth to the transformed data in Komet. Since the data could not be viewed at the
                database level, it was challenging to determine whether discrepancies were due to
                the transformation logic or the user interface. By implementing automated
                integration testing, a comprehensive evaluation of the tools and processes enabled
                us to identify the root causes of discrepancies. For instance, building round-trip
                integration tests that evaluate all parts of the SNOMED CT origin files ensures
                detailed data accuracy. We developed complex testing procedures that validate the
                data from all aspects of the transformation, ensuring traceability of detected
                discrepancies.</para>
            <para>The current quality assurance (QA) measures being implemented within the
                integration tests focus on validating the accuracy of the data obtained and
                transformed from the origin files. This includes validating the semantics in the
                Identifier, Definition, Description, Concepts, and Axioms.</para>
            <para>Previously, running such test scripts took hours, but we were able to reduce the
                time to mere seconds by customizing and optimizing the memory assigned to the Java
                Virtual Machine (JVM) through the new approach to integration tests. This approach
                has been applied to repositories such as SNOMED-CT-data and SNOMED-CT-LOINC-data and
                will be implemented in other repositories like LOINC-data and more, per client’s
                requirement. </para>

        <section>
            <title>Versioning of Data</title>
            <para>Versioning of knowledge standards, such as those from SNOMED CT and LOINC, is a
                crucial aspect of the data transformation process that must be carefully considered.
                Data can exist in multiple versions, which can vary significantly based on
                publication dates and the countries releasing the data. For example, SNOMED CT has
                different release dates and versions tailored for different countries, reflecting
                the unique healthcare terminologies and requirements of each region. Additionally,
                some knowledge standards are still under development. When sharing and validating
                data transformations, it is essential to have a standardized method for naming and
                sharing the data; otherwise, understanding the origin of the data becomes virtually
                impossible. By creating an automated system for versioning starter data,
                transformation data, and code, system safety can be more easily implemented. Maven,
                a build automation tool, utilizes plugins to allow users to pull data or code from a
                centralized repository. Similarly, these plugins enable users to develop different
                variations of the data through standard naming conventions and metadata files. These
                variations can then be published to a central repository, making them available to
                other users and providing additional data to other data models or projects. This
                project structure facilitates easier management of changesets and existing
                transformations by including a MANIFEST.MF document, which supplies additional
                context and information.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Reasoning Knowledge Standards</title>
            <para>The Maven pipeline architecture offers significant advantages by addressing and
                resolving several issues that were prevalent in previous data transformation
                processes. One of the primary benefits is the automation of data reasoning, which
                significantly reduces the complexity and manual effort required. This automation
                ensures that errors in the data can be avoided and managed more effectively when
                identified, thereby enhancing the robustness of data modeling.</para>
            <para>As part of IKM, the use of specific technologies has enabled the prevention and
                management of data errors. The reasoner, a critical component of this architecture,
                creates inferred axioms that prevent the duplication of concepts and validate the
                uniqueness of each concept. This capability was particularly beneficial during the
                recent SNOMED – LOINC collaboration data transformation, where it also identified
                areas for data expansion.</para>
            <para>During the OWL transformation process, an orphaned concept was identified,
                highlighting the complexity of the original data syntax. The OWL transformation
                struggled to define the relationship of this entity to its parent concept. This
                issue underscores the opportunity to leverage more of the OWL syntax to parse the
                original files more comprehensively and model additional data. Furthermore, the
                ability to validate transformations is enhanced by using reasoner results and
                comparing them to the SNOMED CT browser. This comparison involves validating the
                parent and child concepts to ensure they are accurately represented and match the
                expected outcomes.</para>
            <para>In summary, the Maven pipeline architecture allows for automatic reasoning of
                data, which not only reduces the complexity and manual workload but also enhances
                the accuracy and robustness of data transformations. This approach ensures that data
                errors are managed effectively, and the overall data modeling process is more
                reliable and efficient.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Dependency Management</title>
            <para>When completing the transformation of SNOMED CT-LOINC collaboration data, it came
                to the team’s attention that the version of SNOMED CT used was the international
                version. This discrepancy arose during the transformation because our technology was
                able to identify a missing concept in the SNOMED CT US version. By having a
                repeatable process for transformation, the discrepancy was easily detected. This
                highlights the importance of having a robust dependency management system in
                place.</para>
            <para>Dependency management is crucial in ensuring that all components and versions of
                data standards are correctly aligned and used during transformations. The Maven
                pipeline architecture, with its automated processes, helps maintain consistency and
                accuracy by managing dependencies effectively. This reduces the risk of using
                incorrect versions of data standards, which can lead to significant errors in the
                transformation process.</para>
            <para>The identification of the missing concept underscores the need for a process for
                reporting these discrepancies and the necessity for better documentation in the
                specifications. Developers rely heavily on accurate and comprehensive specifications
                to perform successful transformations. Therefore, having the most accurate
                information is essential for a successful transformation.</para>

        <title>Conclusion and Next Steps</title>
        <para>In conclusion, the process of integrating knowledge is inherently complex and presents
            numerous opportunities for errors to be introduced. However, by leveraging advanced
            technology and the implementation of a standardized data transformation process,
            significant strides have been made in preventing system safety issues and identifying
            areas for further improvement.</para>
        <para>As more data transformations are completed, the standard operating procedures for
            Tinkar Importing and Data Transformation will be further refined, ensuring quality and
            consistency. Notably, we were able to identify errors within the Tinkar core codebase by
            utilizing the Maven pipeline to create a dataset based on the latest SNOMED CT
            international origin data. The larger size of the origin data, which was 5-10% greater
            than previous SNOMED CT editions, exposed inefficiencies within our internal
            transformation processes. The ease of use of the pipeline allowed a member from another
            team to process the SNOMED CT origin data, detect a problem, and enable our team to
            enhance the efficiency of our code in processing all datasets. This task would have been
            more tedious and time-consuming without the automated pipeline.</para>
        <para>Additionally, we will focus on optimizing the performance of our transformation
            processes to handle larger datasets more efficiently and continue leveraging the
            automated pipeline to detect and address inefficiencies promptly. These steps will help
            us maintain high-quality data transformations and improve overall system reliability and
            efficiency.</para>
