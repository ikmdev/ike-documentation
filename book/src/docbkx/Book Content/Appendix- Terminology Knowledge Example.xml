    <title>Terminology Knowledge Example</title>
    <para>In this section, we will be discussing a use case using questionnaires and
        responses.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Terminology Knowledge Problem Statement</title>
            <para>As a real-world use case, we focused on improving the diagnosis of emerging acute
                chronic infectious diseases, initially focusing on Long COVID as an example. There
                are numerous areas within clinical workflows for COVID-19 exposure and Long COVID
                diagnosis that are open to improvements that will ultimately help provide safe and
                effective patient care. There is a need to determine clear prioritization principles
                around focus areas for data capture within these COVID-19 workflows. To date, Long
                COVID has been primarily a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that it is often only
                diagnosed after all other conditions are eliminated as a possible cause of symptoms.
                Clinicians need to make quick decisions based on objective and subjective
                observations to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with Long
                COVID and whether the patient should be admitted to the hospital. Clinicians are
                encouraged to leverage technology, virtual visits, and other Health Information
                Technology (IT)-generated clinical data to assist with decision making and
                information sharing. Unfortunately, electronic clinical data is plagued by data
                quality challenges, including variation in how data elements are encoded by
                terminology standards, and stored in clinical information models. These challenges
                can cause inefficiencies in how clinical data elements are identified, retrieved,
                analyzed, and operationalized into workflows at the point-of-care. </para>
            <para>In the current workflows for COVID-19 and Long COVID, clinicians are encouraged to
                rely on electronic clinical data to determine which patients should be prioritized
                for being tested, hospitalized, and/or isolated. Failure to include or exclude
                patients’ screening, testing, and treatment could lead to life-threatening
                situations for patients and could impact the overall trajectory of the outbreak at a
                population-level. Overall, the ability to measure and improve healthcare outcomes
                relies on consistent, high-quality electronic data that is aggregated from a variety
                of Health IT systems across numerous medical centers and healthcare facilities.
                Clinicians need to be able to easily access and fully trust the electronic data they
                are using to make determinations at the point-of-care, key components of High
                Reliability Organizations and Learning Health Systems. </para>
            <para>Using ANF as a standardized statement model to streamline analysis could
                potentially lead to improved and earlier Long COVID diagnoses. This body of work
                aims to focus on workflow areas of data as it is captured for Long COVID – perhaps
                iPad data entry, EHR collection of signs and symptoms, emergency warning signs,
                patient-reported data, etc. – to understand how the collection of data elements in a
                consistent and high-quality manner, and the subsequent data analysis, fit into the
                overall goal of achieving coordinated, national and highly-reliable care.</para>

            <title>Terminology Knowledge Demonstration Objectives</title>
            <para>The objective of this work is to document data collection methods and statement
                model standards to demonstrate the importance of an interoperable data system and
                downstream analytical scenarios through a use case for Long COVID as an example of
                an emerging acute chronic infectious disease. We aim to highlight how Analysis
                Normal Form (ANF) can be used to standardize the representation of equivalent
                concepts associated with data capture, storage and aggregation within the Long COVID
                workflow. This work utilized four main aims to demonstrate how ANF-thinking could
                improve use case outcomes and reduce the clinical burden on data consumers during
                data collection and aggregation:</para>

            <para><emphasis>Aim 1: Review Workflow Schematic for Emerging Acute Chronic Infectious
                    Diseases, specifically focused on Data Capture Elements and Long COVID Value
                    Sets</emphasis>. In support of Task 3.2.1, our team documented a generalized
                workflow and use case schematic for a patient’s journey from COVID-19 exposure to
                Long COVID diagnosis. We focused on decision points related to data capture of signs
                and symptoms related to COVID-19 and outlined key terminology and clinical
                information modeling considerations within the workflow artifacts that were
                developed. </para>
            <para>The team then gathered and reviewed value sets from the National Institute of
                Health’s (NIH) NLM Value Set Authority Center (VSAC) to identify common concepts and
                data elements that would need to be captured to support a Long COVID diagnosis. Each
                team member was assigned a value set and identified common and well documented
                concepts from their respective set, including signs and symptoms, laboratory tests,
                laboratory test results, potential and confirmed exposure, and suspected and
                confirmed infection. The concepts were organized by value set and documented in a
                table.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Aim 2: Draft Potential Questionnaires to Standardize Use Case Data
                    Acquisition</emphasis>. Long COVID is a poorly understood condition where
                patients experience COVID-19 symptoms long past the expected symptomatic period and
                whose symptoms, test results, and timelines can vary drastically between patients.
                The team developed sample questionnaires based on the VSAC value sets to collect
                additional data that patients or providers could enter into a Clinical Input Form or
                questionnaire. Traditional, current-state questionnaires were developed for the Long
                COVID use case to demonstrate how users may struggle to identify the optimal
                selections to document certain symptoms and may result in inconsistent and/or
                duplicative clinical data. The team then worked to develop an improved questionnaire
                that removes redundant and vague concepts and forces more granular and detailed
                selections to highlight ways to enhance the quality, accuracy, and interoperability
                of collected data.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Aim 3: Outline Variability in Statement Representations</emphasis>.
                Current terminology standards vary in the way they represent and code many data
                points that can be acquired through patient questionnaires. Critical information
                regarding severity, site, associated concepts, and data elements can be spread
                across the respective fields, incorporated directly into the concept code, or a
                combination of the two. The table aims to highlight the need for a normalized way to
                represent concepts to prevent loss of critical data and meaning as it is transformed
                and transmitted within and between systems. Improving the data collection, encoding,
                and storage of both present and absent concepts is essential in the effort to
                achieve lossless and interoperable data.</para>
            <para><emphasis>Aim 4: Demonstrate ANF Ability to Standardize Terminology and Capture
                    Critical Data</emphasis>. This paper ultimately aims to improve the acquisition,
                storage, and use of data across a variety of clinical situations, with the Long
                COVID use case as an example. We propose ANF as the tool to standardize and
                normalize the way critical data concepts from patient questionnaires are represented
                before transmitting to other systems for secondary use. The same concepts that were
                shown to have varying representations across terminology standards were modeled
                using a tabular ANF representation to demonstrate how ANF captures the same or more
                detail as other standards and normalizes the formatting of equivalent concepts
                across terminologies. The ANF table captures key data elements for the concept of
                loss of sense of smell since onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The concept ID, author, and
                topic are clearly documented along with timing of onset and recording. Not only is
                the concept itself represented in a normalized way that captures all pertinent
                values and details, but other normalized concepts, like linking to the beginning of
                symptom onset can be linked as associated clinical statements that add additional
                value and context.</para>

            <para><emphasis>Aim 2: Draft Potential Questionnaires to Standardize Use Case Data
                    Acquisition</emphasis>. An initial questionnaire was developed for the
                generalized concepts extracted from the COVID-19 VSAC value sets that poses a simple
                yes or no question for each of the concepts that could potentially aid in a Long
                COVID diagnosis. This chapter focuses on potential questionnaires for ‘Signs and
                Symptoms’ and ‘Non-Specific Respiratory Diagnoses’, outlined in <xref
                    linkend="HypotheticalSignsandSymptomsQuestionnaires"/> and <xref
                    linkend="HypotheticalNonSpecificRespiratoryDiagnosesQuestionnaire"/>
                respectively. [2]</para>

            <para>While the initial version of the questionnaire on the left can collect important
                information and data, the format was improved in the version on the right to reduce
                redundancy, improve clarity, and collect more accurate and granular detail. The
                improved questionnaire forces patients or physicians completing the survey to select
                more granular symptoms and reduces ambiguity. Rather than allowing for individuals
                to select ‘cough’ and ‘dry cough’ or ‘productive cough’, the improved questionnaire
                forces a more accurate selection of either ‘dry cough’ or ‘productive cough’ to
                reduce redundant data. Additionally, the improved questionnaire utilizes
                user-friendly definitions like rapid breathing rather than highly technical
                terminology like ‘tachypnea’ to reduce duplicative symptoms and support accurate
                data collection from a wider audience. The value sets and questionnaires will need
                to be updated as symptoms are more comprehensively understood, and as new symptoms
                are identified. </para>
            <para>The team developed additional questionnaires for non-specific respiratory
                diagnoses below in <xref linkend="HypotheticalNonSpecificRespiratoryDiagnosesQuestionnaire"/>. The diagnoses questionnaires continue to improve data
                quality by reducing duplicative selections and improving granularity by forcing an
                Upper or Lower ‘Viral Respiratory Tract Infection’ rather than allowing the
                selection of both Upper or Lower Viral Respiratory Tract Infection and “Viral
                Respiratory Tract Infection’. These additional questionnaires demonstrate how
                improvements can be made to data collection across a variety of areas associated
                with patient care and can be applied to other emerging acute and chronic infectious
                diseases.</para>

                Building upon the concepts found in the VSAC value sets, the team developed tabular
                representations of certain symptoms to display the variability in the way concepts
                could be represented and coded. <xref linkend="HypotheticalNonSpecificRespiratoryDiagnosesQuestionnaire"/> depicts the symptom of ‘Fever Greater Than
                100.4 Fahrenheit with Chills’ across three example terminology standards as well as
                the null value of a normal body temperature. After reviewing the table, one could
                conclude that the first three examples are semantically the same. Each describe a
                condition of fever greater than 100.4 Fahrenheit, but critical information is spread
                out across the severity, site, and code fields depending on how the respective
                terminology standard represents the condition. This variability leads to sub-optimal
                data capture that can hinder data querying, data use, and the ability to identify
                semantically equivalent concepts.</para>

            <para><emphasis>Aim 4: Demonstrate ANF Ability to Standardize Terminology and Capture
                    Critical Data</emphasis>. The team demonstrated the value of ANF by developing a
                tabular ANF representation for loss of sense of smell since onset of COVID-19
                symptoms. ANF provides a singular, normalized way to represent concepts from
                different terminology standards by restricting various data elements to certain
                fields, like the severity of a particular symptom in the results section.
                Standardizing how data elements are reported facilitates the identification of
                equivalent terminology and improves the quality and interoperability of data. In the
                example below, ANF captures all the pertinent information including the symptom
                itself, option for the severity or numerical value of an observation, and the method
                of the observation, as well as additional information like the timeframe when a
                symptom first occurred. This additional information is an associated term that adds
                value and context to a measurement. </para>
            <para>While documenting symptoms that are marked as present on the improved
                questionnaire in a normalized format is essential, it is also important to represent
                signs and symptoms that are absent in a patient. Corresponding present and absent
                concepts for a certain symptom do not always exist across terminology standards, but
                ANF is able to represent the absence of a symptom using a numerical countable
                quantity, ensuring relevant and pertinent information is not lost.</para>

            <para>This section aims to highlight some of the current shortcomings with the way data
                is collected and represented. We propose the following recommendations for data
                collection via patient questionnaires to reduce duplicative and vague data
                collection, facilitate secondary data usage, and improve data
                interoperability:</para>

                    <para>Restrict data entry and collection with pre-populated patient
                        questionnaires based on established concepts from the appropriate value sets
                        to standardize data collection. This will work when questionnaire designers
                        and data consumers know the data that they are trying to capture. In the
                        context of a condition where the signs and symptoms are less well defined,
                        or have not yet been defined, this methodology may inhibit knowledge
                        discovery and should be supported by integrated knowledge management
                        constructs that facilitate data agility and regular updates to value sets.

                        than highly technical terms such as ‘<emphasis role="italic"

            <title>Technologies that Support ANF </title>
            <para>While standardizing data collection methods is a critical step towards data
                interoperability and ANF data transformations, there are still common sources of
                errors associated with normalizing clinical data. Errors normalizing terminology
                content, terminology semantics, and poorly defined interactions between the input
                and presentation of clinical data are three key problems that still need to be
                addressed. Several transformation languages and architectures exist for expressing
                and executing transformation logic to address the issues above and to normalize
                specific instances of clinical data into ANF. Users can choose a language that is
                best tailored for the format of the data source, while transformation quality and
                accuracy is left to the transformation author. Below is a list of four
                transformation languages and the associated benefits and limitations. While each
                option has its own limitations and cost, the ability to address or minimize common
                normalization errors justifies their use.
