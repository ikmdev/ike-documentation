            need for controlled terminologies was recognized at an early stage in the evolution of
            medical computing systems. Although the fundamental objective of these terminologies
            remained consistent—namely, to facilitate the accurate capture, storage, manipulation,
            and retrieval of information while ensuring the preservation and communication of
            intended meanings—consensus among developers regarding a single, universally applicable
            terminology proved elusive. Through a comprehensive synthesis of medical informatics
            literature and conversations with fellow researchers, Dr. James J. Cimino articulated
            the desiderata for the design of controlled healthcare terminologies. The desiderata was
            first published in 1989 and subsequently expanded in 1998. The resulting framework
            comprises twelve desiderata, which outline the essential characteristics that controlled
            medical terminologies should possess to promote their interoperability, shareability,
            and reusability across diverse healthcare contexts. They are: <?oxy_comment_end?><orderedlist>

                        expected, formally stated processes for requesting and adding content is
                        required. SNOMED CT®, LOINC® and RxNorm all have processes in place for
                        requesting changes to the terminologies either through the organization that
                        maintains them or through a national release center in the case of SNOMED
                        CT®. While content can be added using these processes, there is usually a
                        delay before a formal addition is available for use. In addition to the
                        processes available through the standards development organizations (SDOs),
                        SNOMED CT® includes additional mechanisms for users to extend the
                        terminology and add missing content locally.</para>

                        Richards' semiotic triangle "shows that, although written or spoken symbols
                        (words) cannot completely capture the essence of a reference (thought) or of
                        a referent (thing), there is a correspondence among them. Either a word or
                        an object can inspire a thought, and people may endeavor to express their
                        thoughts with words or by identifying objects in the world. The relationship
                        between a word and a thing is indirect, however. The link can be completed
                        only when an interpreter (usually a person) processes the word, which
                        invokes a corresponding thought, and then links that thought to a thing in
                        the world (the “referent”). This diagram is seductive in its simplicity."

                    <para><quote>By implying a one-to-one relationship between each pair of members
                            in the triangle, this simple diagram masks hidden complexity. Ogden and
                            Richards alluded to this complexity by the dotted line between a symbol
                            and a referent, indicating that the link between a symbol and a referent
                            can only be made indirectly through an interpreter, but the notion that
                            a symbol does—or could—refer to a single thought and that a thought
                            does—or could—refer to a single referent is a fallacy. Thus, it has been
                            historically recognized that multiple terms may refer to the same object
                            or idea, a single term may refer ambiguously to more than one object or
                            idea, and terms may be confusing because they are out of date. It is
                            within this context that we seek solutions to improve our ability to
                            communicate about biomedical concepts.</quote></para>

                        While hierarchical information is paramount, the inclusion of additional
                        definitional knowledge can help maintain and correctly place concepts within
                        the appropriate hierarchy. Allowing computers to use this additional
                        information can aid in properly placing concepts in hierarchies that
                        developers did not originally add to a concept.</para>
                    <para>When content modelers add new content to a terminology, the relationships
                        they create are sometimes called stated relationships. These stated
                        relationships help to give concepts a formal definition and can be used to
                        correctly place a concept in new hierarchies the content modeler did not
                        originally assign. In large terminologies, correctly adding all the possible
                        valid hierarchical relationships can be difficult as it requires the content
                        modeler to think of all the possible parents. By adding the additional
                        information, like Finding Site in the example below, additional hierarchical
                        relationships can be inferred.<figure>

        <para>Terminology systems are increasingly critical components for achieving
            interoperability across applications in the healthcare domain. The role of standard
            terminologies in achieving interoperability for the purposes of advancing patient care
            is well documented. Ideally, these clinical terminology standards intend to provide
            rules to allow for the exchange, integration, and management of electronic clinical
            information. The federal government recognizes the benefit of standard terminologies and
            promotes their development and use. The

            their use through federal payment policies. [30]</para>
        <para>Terminology standards cover different domains of clinical and nonclinical content
            relevant to the EHR, and serve various purposes. Currently, no single terminology or
            classification system contains everything that is needed for the medical record.
            Terminology systems typically consist of the following elements: </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Coded Concepts – the discrete units of knowledge managed within the
                    terminology. They typically consist of numeric codes and textual preferred
                    names, synonyms, and descriptions. </para>

                <para>Concept Hierarchies – the logical organization of concepts into parent-child
                    and ancestor-descendant relationships that express the semantics of
                    generalization and specialization. The hierarchical organization of a
                    terminology may be explicitly expressed through stored parent-child and
                    ancestor-descendant links, or it may be implicitly expressed through the logical
                    definitions of individual concepts that a computer can use to infer parent-child
                    and ancestor-descendant relationships. </para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para>New applications and new medical knowledge constantly call for expansion and
            enhancement of existing terminologies. However, since terminology systems are often
            non-static, incomplete and under specified, inconsistencies may be introduced. </para>
        <para>While many of these challenges are related to terminology evolution, others may be
            related to the design of the standard clinical terminologies themselves. Cimino notably
            described the challenges of concept orientation, completeness, correctness, currency,
            granularity, and redundancy when designing re-usable medical terminologies. Today a
            menagerie of inconsistent and overlapping terminology models hinders efforts that try to
            store and analyze encoded clinical data. The scope of content covered in terminologies
            varies from focusing on a very specific domain to covering multiple domains.</para>

        <para>LOINC® is a global clinical terminology developed by the Regenstrief Institute to
            standardize the identification of health measurements, observations, and documents,
            addressing the challenge of inconsistent local codes in electronic health data exchange.
            It provides unique identifiers and names for a wide range of clinical observations—not
            just laboratory tests—enabling interoperability across health IT systems by pairing
            LOINC® codes for observations with result values, often using SNOMED CT® for the latter.
            Over the years, LOINC® has expanded beyond laboratory data and is maintained by
            committees focused on Laboratory, Clinical, and Radiology areas.
            [1]<?oxy_comment_end?></para>
        <para>Regenstrief continues to update LOINC® and publish twice-yearly releases. New concepts
            are added to LOINC® based on submissions from end users. The current version contains
            more than 99,000 terms covering the full scope of laboratory testing (chemistry,
            microbiology, molecular pathology, …etc.) and a broad range of clinical measurements
            (e.g., vital signs, ECG, patient-reported outcomes, …etc.). In addition to distributing
            the terminology, Regenstrief makes available at no cost a variety of supporting tools
            and resources, including the Regenstrief LOINC® Mapping Assistant (RELMA®) and online
            search application.</para>
        <para>LOINC® uses a semantic data model containing six major and up to four minor attributes
            to create fully-specified names for concepts. The major attributes of the LOINC® name
            are:</para>

        </orderedlist>
        <para>The atomic elements that make up each LOINC® term name are called “Parts” and are also
            assigned identifiers. The combination of attribute values produce term names that are
            [intended to be] detailed enough to distinguish among similar observations. Of the six
            attributes, only the method is optional and used only when necessary to distinguish
            among clinical important differences. </para>
        <para>“A fully specified test result or clinical observation can be described formally with

        <para>Over time, LOINC® has not only grown in size, but also developed additional data
            structures and content around its main codes for individual observations. The LOINC®
            release contains a basic hierarchy that organizes LOINC® codes into a set of is-a
            relationships. LOINC® now has a detailed model for representing enumerated collections
            of observations, such as laboratory panels (complete blood count), assessment
            instruments (e.g., PHQ-9), data sets (National Trauma Data Standard), and forms (e.g.,
            U.S. Standard Birth Certificate). This content is published in a special release
            artifact called the LOINC® Database, which is released twice a year (usually in June and
            December). LOINC® also has a detailed model for connecting observation terms to
            structured answer lists. These answer lists can be defined by extension or intension and
            linked to observation terms with different types (e.g., example, preferred, normative).
            This content is published in the LOINC® Answer List File, which is updated alongside the
            latest LOINC Database, and includes mappings to other terminologies such as SNOMED CT®,
            where they exist. LOINC® now also publishes the atomic elements (called Parts) that make
            up each LOINC® term name. The LOINC® Part File includes the Part identifiers and names,
            links between Parts and LOINC® terms, and mappings from LOINC® Parts to other
            terminologies such as SNOMED CT® and RxNorm where they exist.</para>

                    <para>While the initial partnership and memorandum of understanding signed

                        to facilitate interoperability and minimize duplication of effort, the
                        collaborative relationship did not accomplish a complete integration of the
                        two disparate terminologies. Further integration has been proposed to
                        leverage SNOMED CT®’s model for the representation of LOINC® building blocks
                        and for a more consistent representation of clinical and laboratory
                        observations in SNOMED CT®. Furthermore, the use of description logics for
                        the representation of LOINC® was not accomplished under this initial
                        partnership in 2013 and only SNOMED CT® currently uses this formalism.
                        LOINC® still uses its distinct formalisms and tools for its representation,
                        has its own release cycles and versioning mechanisms, which makes seamless

                <para>Without concepts of polyhierarchy, concept orientation, and concept
                    definition, there is additional pressure on technicians and other stakeholders
                    to correctly specify the correct LOINC® code: “When the terminology model is
                    ultimately weak, it forces more onto the [statement] model”. [15] “A challenge
                    that remains to be solved is the binding of statement model and terminology.
                    There is often no clear demarcation between what is represented in the statement
                    model and what is represented in the terminology.” [9] </para>
                <para>Consequently, laboratory technicians may select a LOINC® code with an
                    incorrect part (i.e., the incorrect specimen or analyte) due to LOINC®’s
                    multiaxial hierarchy, resulting in difficulties for data aggregation and
                    understanding across both different technicians and institution. [12] It has
                    been reported that choosing different ‘properties’ (i.e., parts) was the most
                    frequent reason that different coding choices were made. [16] In a “study about
                    correctness of LOINC® mapping, choosing different ‘Method’, ‘Scale’ and
                    ‘Property’ attributes was the most common reason for different coding choices
                    among three large institutions. For example, in the ‘Method’ axis, some
                    institutions usually use a code that specifies the method (when available),
                    whereas other institutions always choose terms that are “methodless”. Another
                    example, is that in the ‘Scale/Property’ axes, LOINC® uses two distinct styles
                    (Prid:Nar VS. Prid:Nom) for reporting the interpretation of laboratory tests
                    (e.g. CFTR gene mutation analysis). The Narrative (Nar) scale is for free text
                    results (sentences, paragraphs, sections), whereas the Nominal (Nom) scale is
                    used for representing coded values, as when selecting an organism found on
                    culture from a coded list of bacteria. The differences between these types are
                    often subtle and require understanding the reporting system. Steindel et al.
                    also concluded that for some purposes, such as finding any code that could be
                    used to indicate the presence of a particular disease, rolling up LOINC® codes
                    and ignoring some LOINC® axes (e.g. method, scale, or property) can be
                    beneficial.” [16]</para>
                <para>There is not much management in terms of education in what codes are used for,
                    and medical technicians often do not have the LOINC® level of knowledge for
                    encoding that is necessarily expected. [17] The results in the following example
                    offer insight into how different codes may be selected for the same test from
                    different laboratories. </para>

                <para>Depending on the lab, technicians may choose different LOINC® codes for the
                    same test. The College of American Pathologists (CAP) surveyed 90 lab
                    participants on “practice setting, instrument(s) and test method(s), and LOINC®
                    code selection and usage in the laboratory and electronic health records” for 10
                    commonly ordered tests. 19.6% of codes reported were incorrect, with the highest
                    error rates “observed in the property (27 of 275, 9.8%), system (27 of 275,
                    9.8%), and component (22 of 275, 8.0%) LOINC® axes. Errors in LOINC® code
                    selection included selection of the incorrect component (e.g., activated
                    clotting time instead of activated partial thromboplastin time); selection of
                    panels that can never be used to obtain an individual analyte (e.g., prothrombin
                    time panel instead of international normalized ratio); and selection of an
                    incorrect specimen type.” </para>

                                test, which used a component “activated clotting time” instead of
                                “coagulation surface induced”</para>

                            <para>System – Between the different labs, some codes selected had the
                                system as control blood (Bld^Control), platelet-poor plasma (PPP),
                                or whole blood (Bld).</para>

                <para>For a Prothrombin Time (PT) test, labs reported three different LOINC® codes
                    that could be selected. Results differed due to some labs incorrectly selecting
                    panels or the wrong system. For a D-Dimer test, results differed to differences
                    in component, property, system, and method.</para>
                <para>As referenced in the table "Correspondence of SNOMED CT® to Ciminos
                    Desiderata", many of the errors occurred from different selections in system,
                    where the system could be whole blood or platelet form plasma. “For the
                    analyzers used by the laboratories in this survey, coagulation tests such as
                    APTT and International Normalized Ratio (INR) are performed on PPP and are never
                    performed on whole blood, so the selection of a code that indicates the system
                    as PPP would more accurately represent the test performed as opposed to a code
                    that lists the system as blood (Bld). Superficially, an end-user may think that
                    “Bld” is a nonspecific answer for a collected blood specimen. However, LOINC®
                    has defined the system part term Bld as whole blood as indicated in section 2.5
                    of the LOINC® User's Guide V2.65.”</para>
                <para>LOINC® is an international standard which means that there are terms that only
                    apply to foreign assays but are still available for use by laboratories in the
                    U.S. This results in concepts such as “Whole Blood” that mean something
                    different than intended. End-users commonly use this concept when they intend to
                    represent “platelet form plasma”; this results in highly prevalent errors in
                    CoAg testing because the LOINC® concept for “Whole Blood” is perceived to be a
                    general term when it is not. [15]</para>

                    post-coordination), relationships should exist between the codes that support
                    the assertion of equivalence. Use of a Description Logics reasoner can help in
                    overcoming important drawbacks of multi-axial systems: (1) the capability of
                    detecting semantic equivalence of syntactically different expressions, and (2)

                        Center (Nebraska Medicine) has maintained an extension namespace (extension
                        identifier 1000004 registered with International Health Terminology

                        pragmatically by recording requirements reported by Nebraska clinicians in
                        the course of their daily work. This content has been deployed in records

                        Observables project of the IHTSDO and Regenstrief Institute published a
                        draft convergent concept model for harmonization of content between LOINC®
                        and SNOMED CT®. In January 2017, the project published a set of SNOMED CT®
                        formatted expressions that define the meaning of ~13000 laboratory LOINC®
                        observables employing the harmonized concept model. An expanded technology
                        preview of ~20,000 concepts has been released by the IHTSDO but is not
                        included in this publication. UNMC has converted the earlier expression set
                        into SNOMED CT® formatted extension concepts employing LOINC® long names as
                        the SNOMED CT® fully specified name and assigning class supertypes within
                        the Observable entity hierarchy in SNOMED CT®. ‘Grouper’ concepts have been
                        modeled and deployed within the Observable entity hierarchy in order to
                        enhance clinical navigation and to support common query use cases in
                        laboratory medicine and pathology. Anatomic and molecular pathology
                        observables defined by semantic analysis of the CAP Annotated Cancer
                        Protocols explained in 3.3 are included. Some pre-existing SNOMED CT®
                        Observable entity content has been fully defined using the harmonized
                        concept model with permission of the IHTSDO. Grouper concepts have been
                        included to organize the ontology and support common query use cases
                        proposed by CAP. All content was run through the description logic
                        classifier and both ‘stated’ and ‘inferred’ relationships are included in
                        this release. This “Observables ontology” for laboratory medicine and
                        pathology is being published for evaluation and comment by the informatics
                        community.</emphasis> [23]</para>

                    expands beyond just LOINC® and SNOMED®, but that could also represent additional

                <title>Quality Control</title>
                <para>Current quality control of LOINC® is limited or not known. While the
                    aforementioned Quality Assurance study proved that use of Description Logic is
                    promising and beneficial for terminologies such as LOINC®, these types of
                    quality assurance methods are not widely used. </para>
                <para>The only published quality metrics from Regenstrief about LOINC® include
                    published stats about their submission queue describing how long it takes to

                <para>Regenstrief relies on an occasional survey (either once per year or once every
                    few years) from ONC to the laboratory community to assess how labs are using
                    LOINC®, what are the barriers, etc.; however, the survey is very LOINC®-centric
                    and not so much about the quality of the terminology standard itself. </para>
                <para>LOINC® is user-driven, so all submissions are coming from the community. This
                    is beneficial in that there is transparency and openness to the curation of
                    content. However, the current curation is inadequate, and there is no systemic
                    approach to ensure no overlap between terms. </para>

        <para>Since its origin as the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) in 1965, SNOMED
            has evolved significantly in both content and structure, growing from about 15,000 to
            over 350,000 active concepts. Early versions used multi-axial systems for organizing
            medical concepts, but later versions, starting with SNOMED RT®, adopted a more formal
            description logic approach, which continues in SNOMED CT®. This evolution reflects
            increasing rigor and complexity in representing clinical knowledge, as seen in the
            changing ways concepts like “arthritis” are defined and structured across SNOMED®'s
            history.<?oxy_comment_end?> [1] </para>

        <para>Since SNOMED CT® was first release in January 2003, it has been updated twice twice a
            year with new versions. These updates expand its coverage across clinical areas, such as
            diseases, findings, procedures, body strcutures, and substances. Recent enhancements
            include additional content related to genomics and rare diseases, as well as better
            tooling for users. [1]

        <para>While SNOMED CT® has made much progress in their use of description logics, and have
            also provided a tool on github, snomed-owl-toolkit, to facilitate the conversion and
            classification process, the official distribution of OWL refsets has yet to be seen. It
            seems one reason is the lack of current clinical systems to utilize them at this time.

                <listitem>
                    <para>SNOMED CT® is actively collaborating and harmonizing with other biomedical
                        data standards, including maintaining mappings with systems like ICD-10,
                        ICPC-2, ICNP, and especially LOINC®, where LOINC® specifies the question and
                        SNOMED CT® provides the answer for clinical data exchange. These
                        collaborations extend to specialized domains, such as rare diseases (with
                        Orphanet), medical devices (with GMDNA), and through contributions from
                        organizations like Kaiser Permanente. Additionally, SNOMED CT® supports
                        national and community-specific extensions, allowing member countries and
                        specialized fields to include concepts relevant to their unique needs.

                    <para>In October 2022, the Regenstrief Institute (RII) and SNOMED International,
                        also known as International Health Terminology Standards Development
                        Organization (IHTSDO), signed a cooperative agreement to align LOINC® and
                        SNOMED CT®. This collaboration aims to eliminate duplicate data and enable
                        both terminologies to work together by incorporating the LOINC® standard as
                        an extension within SNOMED CT®. As a result, LOINC® content will become more

                <title>Licensing Conditions</title>
                <para>There are also licensing conditions to SNOMED CT® that historically prevented
                    its use as a common format for LOINC®. [14] This issue needs to be addressed for
                    building on SNOMED CT®'s foundation. Nonetheless, SNOMED CT®'s commitment to
                    develop and expand their use of description logics formalism as called out by
                    Tinkar efforts as well as their alignment with the Desiderata as described by
                    Cimino, et at, is a step in the right direction.</para>

                <title>Submission Process Time</title>
                <para>While SNOMED CT® has a process for handling new concept requests and
                    submissions, it is lengthy and not amenable to rapidly changing conditions as
                    seen with COVID-19. While workarounds can be done, what is needed is a formal,
                    standardized, and agile process to accommodate quickly changing
                    conditions/situations. The ability to share and aggregate data nationally, if
                    not internationally, is paramount.</para>

                <title>Compositional Complexity </title>
                <para>While SNOMED CT® uses explicit, elaborate axioms to clarify meaning, its
                    complex representation (compositional grammar) limits its broad adoption. [15]
                    The learning curve to appropriately learn, author, and represent concepts using
                    SNOMED CT®'s compositional grammar (for post-coordinated expressions) and
                    constraint language is steep, resulting in few who want to spend the resources
                    to learn. In addition, even for those who learn it, it takes substantial
                    experience to develop the expertise to understand and demonstrate concept
                    redundancy in a consistent and correct manner.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Inconsistent Representation</title>
                <para>There are multiple ways to represent SNOMED CT® concepts, leading to
                    inconsistent representation (i.e., lack of equivalence), ambiguity, and patient
                    harm from low data quality. SNOMED CT® is still up for constant refinement
                    especially for improving and standardizing concept representation, which makes
                    it difficult for the user to determine equivalence, both within and across
                    terminologies.</para>

                <title>Interpretive Comments</title>
                <para>Interpretive comments are meant to enrich measurement results. One specific
                    example is a statement of measurement uncertainty, which is required by some
                    metrological guidelines. Measurement uncertainty is invaluable in the correct
                    interpretation of measurement results. [15] Because interpretive comments can be
                    of crucial importance in patient care, it is critical to expand SNOMED CT® to
                    thoroughly capture these concepts.</para>

                Further integration has been proposed but will require additional resources to bring
                these terminologies closer together. However, the collaboration between SNOMED CT®
                and LOINC® has been renewed. Creating a LOINC® extension of SNOMED CT® to leverage
                the strengths of both has been the popular notion. This notion has been particularly
                attractive for the SNOMED CT®'s polyhierarchal structure and inferencing
                capabilities. This concept leads to embrace a greater compatibility and
                interoperability, integration of SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm, while noting
                different formalisms and tools for their representation in these technologies. [26]
                Various terminologies have different semantics, models, release cycles, and
                versioning mechanisms. [1] While there is recognition that terminologies are not
                standardized at the exchange level, there is no consensus about harmonized next
                steps to solve the challenges.</para>

            <para>Despite the guiding principles for terminology design and representation
                summarized above, “LOINC® does not fulfill the definition of a computable medical
                terminology as articulated by Cimino et al., that being one based in concept
                orientation, concept definition, and polyhierarchy. These characteristics enable the
                logical inference between concepts, parts, and part elements.” [12] LOINC® is a
                well-maintained terminology – there is a deprecation process and has concept
                permanence where codes aren’t reused – but they do not establish the basic
                parameters of hierarchy and polyhierarchy. And, they are violating the tenants of
                Cimino’s Desiderata.</para>

            <para>SNOMED CT® is the terminology of our current awareness most closely aligns with
                the Desiderata, meeting all requirements described by Cimino. As stated elsewhere,
                it uses Description Logics for computability and facilitates the use of reasoners to
                determine equivalence among various syntactic representations. The primary downsides
                are 1) Some proprietary concepts that limits its usefulness for interoperability and
                2) Lengthy concept submissions process for consideration into either the National or
                International editions. This lack of agility, efficiency and speed is apparent in
                crisis situations such as COVID-19 pandemic. Otherwise, it has proven to be robust
                and has a large global community to assist with its development and vetting.</para>

            <title>Comparison of RxNorm to Cimino’s Desiderata</title>
            <para>While RxNorm meets most of the Desiderata’s requirements, there are a few that are
                not met. Of particular importance is the lack of Description Logics. Use of a
                Description Logics reasoner can help in overcoming important drawbacks of
                multi-axial systems: (1) the capability of detecting semantic equivalence of
                syntactically different expressions, and (2) the automated classification of
                concepts in a hierarchy. RxNorm has another issue of not being a global standard as
                its development and main use is in the U.S. where it is a nationally recognized
                standard, i.e. Meaningful Use. </para>
            <para>However, recent work by Bona et al. have been developing a Drug Ontology product
                (DrOn), based on RxNorm and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest Ontology, which
                is a modular and extensible ontology of drug products, their ingredients and
                biological activity to enable comparative effectiveness and allow researchers to
                query National Drug Codes (NDCs) in multiple ways. Bone et al. go on to say the
                following:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">We have implemented a full accounting of national drug
                    codes and RxNorm unique concept identifiers as information content entities, and
                    of the processes involved in managing their creation and changes. This includes
                    an OWL file that implements and defines the classes necessary to model these
                    entities. A separate file contains an instance-level prototype in OWL that
                    demonstrates the feasibility of this approach to representing NDCs and the
                    RxCUIs and the processes of managing them by retrieving and representing several
                    individual NDCs, both active and inactive, and the RxCUIs to which they are
                    connected. We also demonstrate how historic information about these identifiers
                    in DrOn can be easily retrieved using a simple SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query
                    Language (SPARQL).</emphasis>[13]</para>
            <para>This development may have a significant impact on improving knowledge management
                as well as the ability to utilize Description Logics reasoners with its attendant
                benefits.</para>

            <title>Knowledge Representation and Description Logic</title>
            <para>A report in the 2016 Yearbook of Medical Informatics defines terminology as “a
                system of concepts with assigned identifiers and human language terms, typically
                involving some kind of semantic hierarchy. Some systems may support the assignment
                of multiple terms, or synonyms, to a given concept; these may include terms in
                multiple natural languages, such as English or Dutch.” [10] This definition implies
                that knowledge representation for a terminology system may not always be based on a
                strict defining hierarchy. The advantage, or disadvantage, of such an approach is
                that the terminology, such as LOINC® for instance, might appear to be rather
                intuitive and human-readable and comprehensible. However, when delving into complex
                use cases, a lack of formal defining structure may reveal that it is difficult to
                understand the precise meaning of the terminological representations and that use of
                a system such as LOINC® may differ widely amongst humans. Further exacerbating
                potential variability is the heterogeneous behavior of tools implemented to reason
                with terminological structures. [11] </para>
            <para>The field of Knowledge Representation and “Description Logics” was developed out
                of the attempt to formally define “intuitive representations” with a formal
                semantics to establish a common ground for human and tool interoperability.
                Knowledge representation involves the design of formalisms for expressing knowledge
                about a particular domain and focuses on representing and characterizing classes of
                objects and relationships between them. </para>
            <para>An ideal state terminology that relies on description logics may invoke more
                formal semantic relationships between and among concepts. Use of a Description
                Logics reasoner can help in overcoming important drawbacks of multi-axial systems
                and other non-standard, distinct formalisms: (1) the capability of detecting
                semantic equivalence of syntactically different expressions, and (2) the automated
                classification of concepts in a hierarchy.

                <para>The language used to describe a component must be concordant with the
                    underlying semantics of the object being identified. Therefore, there needs to
                    be guidelines in place to ensure only correct terms are associated with an
                    object in Solor.</para>
                <para>Having a consistent naming convention defined will assist with textual queries
                    to identify duplicates when concepts are primitive and not able to be fully
                    defined using relationships within Solor. Having a consistent way of
                    representing Fully Specified Names will alleviate the issue of users creating
                    duplicate concepts like &quot;Disorder of immune function&quot; and &quot;Immune
                    function disorder&quot;.</para>
                <para>Consistent naming is also important to support effective retrieval. For
                    example, the SNOMED CT® concept 386560004 |Glasgow coma score finding (finding)|
                    has 13 children all with the string Glasgow coma scale instead of Glasgow coma
                    score. </para>
                <para>Another common issue is to add a synonym to a concept that is more specific
                    than the concept itself. A concept should only have synonyms that accurately
                    represent a concept and not any of its children. If a synonym has a more
                    specific meaning, a new concept should be created.</para>

                    Requirements</title>
                <para>For a search engine to retrieve meaningful results, it must be able to
                    understand common usages of everyday jargon, similar to how synonyms are used to
                    help broaden the way to express the same word. This section describes several
                    strategies used to help with a query.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Word variants</emphasis> – Similar to synonyms, word
                    variants are used to express the same word. While synonyms are explicitly
                    created as a term to describe a concept (for example, SNOMED CT®'s "Heart
                    attack" and "Myocardial infarction"), word variants are utilized during
                    searching to assist in finding the correct concept, rather than explicitly
                    creating the term. Hypothetical example - if "kidney failure" is a term created
                    for a concept, a word variant of 'renal' could be created for 'kidney'. Instead
                    of explicitly creating a separate term of "renal failure", this word variant
                    could be utilized during searching to find all concepts that have the explicit
                    term of "kidney failure" when a user enters "renal failure" by replacing "renal"
                    with "kidney". This would create the burden of creating all possible variant
                    terms for a given word.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Misspellings</emphasis> – Certain terms are more
                    commonly misspelled when searching over healthcare descriptions. The ability for
                    a search mechanism to recognize them and to search over both the correct and
                    incorrect spellings will help to identify the correct concept. For example,
                    perineal vs peroneal and aphagia vs aphasia. </para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Word order</emphasis> – Terms can be combined in
                    different ways to mean the same synonym. The ability to search over a term in
                    varying order of phrases is important. For example, Disorder of the eye vs Eye
                    disorder.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Components query</emphasis> – The importance of this
                    searching strategy comes into play when a certain focus is desired for the
                    search result. For example, in LOINC®, there may be circumstances where a
                    certain axis is desired for the search. Similarly, a certain hierarchy may be
                    desired when searching in SNOMED CT®. For example, "cold" is a synonym of common
                    cold (a disorder) in SNOMED CT®, and also exists as "cold sensation quality" (a
                    qualifier value). By allowing users to limit the search criteria (disorder vs.
                    qualifier), the most appropriate query result will be returned to the
                    user.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Active and inactive</emphasis> – Concepts and terms will
                    come in and out of use over time. This is often indicated by an active/inactive
                    designation. In order to properly return concepts/terms that are active, query
                    parameters must contain a parameter to designate if the query result
                    should/should not return active and inactive concepts or terms.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Regular Expressions</emphasis> - Regular expression or
                    regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. This pattern
                    would allow a user to retrieve results based on a certain pattern. For example
                    "a|b*" would return all "a", "b" and other b's that fits the pattern such as
                    "bb", "bbb", "bab", etc. Since the depth and breadth of regular expression is
                    beyond the scope of this document, various syntaxes, usage and explanation can
                    be found in many resources such as <link xlink:href="https://regexr.com/"/>.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Grouping Results by hierarchy</emphasis> - This search
                    requirement can be thought of as a complement to "components query". After
                    casting a wide net, results could be a bag of various terms (common cold vs.
                    feeling cold) that may be cumbersome for users to sift through if it is not
                    organized in an orderly fashion. Therefore, if results are placed together in a
                    logical grouping, it would assist the user in finding the appropriate query
                    result. For example, in SNOMED CT®, it may be worthwhile to group results by
                    hierarchy (disorder vs. procedures) to allow a user to look for a result in a
                    desired domain or in RxNorm where all Ingredient results are grouped separately
                    from Semantic Clinical Drug results.</para>

        <title>Definitional</title>
        <para>We, as humans, are able to express individual concepts and expand on just the name of
            the concept, because we are able to associate certain characteristics to individual
            concepts to further describe itself, as well as establishing connections or
            relationships between concepts. Once concepts have a meaning beyond just a name, and
            have relationships to other meaningful concepts, then reasoning can occur. </para>
        <para>While the purpose of Language is to provide necessary vocabulary to express various
            domains of medicine, the purpose of the Definitions are to expand on just a name to go
            with an idea - single concepts with a name by itself adds no value. In other words, a
            system must be capable of capturing not just the words of the concept, but also provide
            a mechanism to express characteristics of that concept (it has the color white [assuming
            color and white are already defined]) and relationships between concepts (it is a
            beta-blocker). Additionally, once relationships of meaningful concepts are established,
            reasoning can occur (beta-blocker is used to treat high blood pressure, therefore, it
            treats high blood pressure).</para>
        <para>Once a system is able to 'digest' the meaning of concepts, it can begin to utilize
            logic to conduct reasoning. In the field of computer science, the study of Description
            Logic is to represent the domain, then using these concepts to specify properties of
            objects and individuals occuring in the domain. Additionally, another feature of
            Description Logic is the capability to conduct reasoning on represented knowledge. The
            goal of this section is to first provide a primer to those who may not be fully immersed
            in the study of description logic, then an introduction to Solor designs to allow for a
            robust representation and relationships of concepts, followed by topics or concerns from
            Solor developers and contributors that necessitate a discussion on why these concerns
            could affect a system to conduct reasoning properly or successfully. </para>

            <para>DL consist of a family of formal knowledge representation language that implements
                mathematical logic to support formal expressions, reasoning, and formal proof. It is
                typically more expressive than propositional logic, which only deals with fixed
                truth values, which may or may not be true
                (<?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190305T155849-0700" comment="Should be &quot;e.g.&quot; instead of &quot;i.e.&quot;  Same for example below for books or temperature." id="cpw_mqc_1hb" flag="done"?><?oxy_comment_start author="erhwang" timestamp="20190307T083716-0700" comment="fixed" parentID="cpw_mqc_1hb" flag="done" mid="41"?>e.g.

                variables to represent 'things' (e.g. books or temperature). However, it is less
                expressive than first-order logic, which assumes the world contains Objects,
                Relations and Functions, allows variables and can quantify over non-logical objects.
                The main design principle of Description Logics is its balance between expressivity
                and computational complexity to suit different applications, with medical ontology
                modeling being one use case. </para>
            <para>DLs provides a way to model the domain by providing three entities: concepts,

            <para>Instead of fully describing the state of a domain, as one would with a database,
                DLs contain axioms, or statements. These axioms capture partial knowledge about the
                situation that the ontology is describing, and there may be many different states of
                the world that are consistent with the ontology<footnote>

            <para>Today's health care terminology standards encompass methods, terminologies, and
                specifications for the exchange, storage, and retrieval of information associated
                with health care systems. These standards contain terminologies and concepts that
                are used in medical records to describe patient symptoms, lab results, prescription
                medications, etc. In today's health care industry, the standard approach to
                integrating multiple disparate health data sources is to conduct mapping, a manual
                process that attempts to associate data to different systems for exchanging patient
                information and other data. Mapping, while pragmatically actionable, is prone to
                information loss and errors.</para>
            <para>Preserving the meaning of information when exchanging electronic health record
                data (i.e., semantic interoperability) is critical for delivering safe patient care
                and leveraging standards-based clinical decision support. Given that individuals
                often receive health care from more than one health system, integration of data from
                multiple sources is needed to ‘view’ a patient’s complete health record and avoid
                erroneous clinical decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information, such as
                decisions that lead to performing unnecessary tests or giving a patient a drug to
                which they are known to be allergic. To date, the strategy for achieving semantic
                interoperability between the clinical systems of the Department of Defense (DoD) and
                the Veterans Administration (VA) has been to ‘map’ millions of data elements used in
                the respective EHRs to standard terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and
                RxNorm). However, ‘round trip testing’ of the mapped concepts has identified
                problems with the quality of the mappings for bidirectional use. New strategies are
                required to achieve semantic interoperability to support safe patient care, both
                before and after the two organizations start using a single vendor for their
                electronic health record systems. The use of logical definitions and terminology
                system extensions to manage concepts used in the delivery of care can overcome key
                challenges with the mapping strategy.</para>

                <title>Mapping is Operational, but Incomplete</title>
                <para>Despite the fact that mapping is plagued by challenges (e.g., being out of
                    date, not scalable, inconsistent, overly complex, incoherent, unstandardized),
                    it still serves an operational need. Current data standards hinder true
                    interoperability, so mapping allows disparate organizations to share and use at
                    least some of their clinical data across health systems. In this section, we
                    will highlight some of the immediate benefits that mapping provides from an
                    operational perspective. Subsequently, we will discuss the challenges associated
                    with mapping. These challenges may ultimately compromise patient safety and
                    clinical decisions. </para>

                    <title>Example of Challenges due to Mapping</title>
                    <para>Mapping is an approach to share data; unfortunately, mapping at each step
                        in the data exchange process creates additional opportunities for error and
                        for loss of information that may lead to a patient’s harm. SNOMED CT® and
                        other meaningful use standards are frequently used as targets of this
                        mapping, and their use is mandated as part of the Meaningful Use
                        regulations. Tables 1 and 2 below show how equivalent concepts in two
                        different care settings leads to information loss when they are mapped to
                        SNOMED CT® because SNOMED CT® does not represent the equivalent meaning. In
                        Tables 1 and 2, the Local Concept column represents the concept created by
                        Hospital A during the care of a patient, the Map Type column specifies
                        broader than or narrower than or equivalent, and the SNOMED CT® Concept
                        column represents the concept to which the local concept has been mapped.
                        The Meaning Lost column describes the information lost due to mapping
                        because an equivalent match of the local concept is not found in SNOMED CT.
                        In Table 1 below, the SNOMED CT® Concept is broader than the local concept,
                        causing important tumor morphology information to be lost during mapping. In
                        Table 2, the SNOMED CT® Concept is also broader than the local concept,
                        causing important tumor location information to be lost in the mapping
                        process.</para>

                    highlighted issues with completeness, correctness, and redundancy in the UMLS
                    Metathesaurus, particularly in its coverage of disease concepts. The UMLS does
                    not necessarily look at semantic equivalence of concepts across or within
                    terminologies, rather focusing on lexical equivalence. A good example of this is
                    how the UMLS has represented content from SNOMED CT® in the pharmaceutical
                    product and substance hierarchies. SNOMED CT® has separate concepts to represent
                    the substance that makes up a pharmaceutical product, for example acetaminophen,
                    and a higher level concept in the pharmaceutical product hierarchy that is used
                    to group products together (all products that contain acetaminophen). In the
                    UMLS these concepts are grouped together under a single UMLS Concept Unique
                    Identifier (CUI).</para>
                <para>These issues related to integrating clinical content have a direct impact on
                    patient safety and point to the need to be able to consistently represent and
                    encode clinical data and observations. Therefore, quality assurance is an
                    indispensable part of the terminology management lifecycle. A central limitation
                    of integrating controlled medical terminologies is that they often lack any
                    formal model to denote the relationships among constituent data elements. </para>
                <para>Recently, however, development teams for SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm have
                    partnered to promote interoperability. Developers can now leverage SNOMED CT®’s
                    representation model for the building blocks of LOINC®, and a new drug model in
                    SNOMED CT® facilitates extensions and consistency to RxNorm. Bodenreider et al.
                    wrote about the recent collaboration: “while this evolution leads to greater
                    compatibility and interoperability, integration of SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and
                    RxNorm still requires mappings among the three terminologies. Moreover, these
                    three terminologies use different formalisms and tools for their representation,
                    have their own release cycles and versioning mechanisms, which makes their
                    seamless integration non trivial, if at all possible.”

The NLM, also, in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, hosts the Value Set Authority Center (VSAC). The VSAC aims to provide lists of values, codes, and names (i.e., value sets) from standard clinical terminologies to represent clinical concepts.

Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)
Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) created OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to inform the appropriate use of observational healthcare databases for studying the effects of medical products. ATHENA is used to harmonize disparate coding systems—with minimal information loss—to a standardized vocabulary. The Standard Vocabulary is a foundational tool that enables transparent and consistent content across disparate observational databases, and serves to support the OHDSI research community in conducting efficient and reproducible observational research.
OHDSI categorizes source terminology concepts in three ways:
Standard Concept: &quot;official&quot; concepts used to represent unique clinical entities in the CDM.
Classification Concept: have a hierarchical relationship to Standard Concepts and can be used to query for Standard Concepts using the records of the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table. However, they cannot appear in the Data Tables.
Source Concept: all remaining Concepts that are not Standard or Classification Concepts 
OHDSI&apos;s Standard Vocabulary relies heavily on mapping non-standard concepts to the Standard Concepts. &quot;"?></para><?oxy_comment_end?>

                <title>SOLOR</title>
                <para>What’s needed is a semantically normalized information model (i.e., Solor)
                    with an appropriate separation of concerns in regard to the informatics
                    architectural layers. Such a model is critical for the success of a number of
                    forward-thinking healthcare initiatives. Solor does not map one terminology
                    system to another and instead integrates terminology content (LOINC®, SNOMED
                    CT®, RxNorm, etc.) from its native format into a common Solor format. Once the
                    content is in Solor, where equivalency is determined through various methods,
                    concepts of the same idea are aggregated. For example, Gentamycin from SNOMED
                    CT® is the same as Gentamycin from LOINC®, and is also the same Gentamycin from
                    RxNorm. The end result from this process is the creation of a Solor concept that
                    is devoid of any source information (but will have traceability), and is exposed
                    to the user to view, use, and extend. In the Gentamycin example, a user will
                    find a concept that is devoid of any source information and will not need to
                    know if this is the SNOMED CT®/LOINC®/RxNorm Gentamycin that needs to be
                    selected. Solor concepts are identified using a Universally Unique Identifier
                    (UUID).</para>

                    <title> The Solor Solution</title>
                    <para>The new approach to data integration involves the use of description logic
                        to model and manage concepts from standard terminologies to support clinical
                        care. Instead of mapping an existing local code or term to a standard code
                        with the goal of creating semantic equivalence, challenges created by
                        mapping were avoided by directly representing concepts using standard codes
                        or logical expressions that conform to a description logic model. We
                        described the strategy for representing ‘things’ (i.e. meanings) about
                        patient care using existing single LOINC®, SNOMED®, and RxNorm concepts,
                        computable logical expressions based on LOINC®, SNOMED CT®, or RxNorm that
                        are added to extensions managed by an organization, organization specific
                        identifiers to support specific local needs, and by adding ‘names’ (i.e.,
                        new dialect-specific synonyms) to already-existing ‘things’. Finally,
                        ‘alternate identifiers’ for LOINC®, SNOMED®, or RxNorm concepts are useful
                        for integrating historical data so source terms (linked to alternative
                        identifiers) are accurately represented using standard concepts defined
                        using description logic. LOINC®, SNOMED CT®, and RxNorm form the foundation
                        of Solor given that they are meaningful use standards, where when integrated
                        together, represent the breadth of information necessary for clinical data
                        representation.

                            to distribute these terminologies. For example: If organization A is

                            organization A needs to ensure it has a license to redistribute LOINC®
