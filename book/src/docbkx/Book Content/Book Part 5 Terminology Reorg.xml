            need for controlled terminologies was recognized at an early stage in the evolution of
            medical computing systems. Although the fundamental objective of these terminologies
            remained consistent—namely, to facilitate the accurate capture, storage, manipulation,
            and retrieval of information while ensuring the preservation and communication of
            intended meanings—consensus among developers regarding a single, universally applicable
            terminology proved elusive. Through a comprehensive synthesis of medical informatics
            literature and conversations with fellow researchers, Dr. James J. Cimino articulated
            the desiderata for the design of controlled healthcare terminologies. The desiderata was
            first published in 1989 and subsequently expanded in 1998. The resulting framework
            comprises twelve desiderata, which outline the essential characteristics that controlled
            medical terminologies should possess to promote interoperability, shareability, and
            reusability across diverse healthcare contexts. They are [1] <?oxy_comment_end?><orderedlist>

                        expected, formally stated processes for requesting and adding content is
                        required. SNOMED CT®, LOINC® and RxNorm all have processes in place for
                        requesting changes to the terminologies either through the organization that
                        maintains them or through a national release center in the case of SNOMED
                        CT®. While content can be added using these processes, there is usually a
                        delay before a formal addition is available for use. In addition to the
                        processes available through the standards development organizations (SDOs),
                        SNOMED CT® includes additional mechanisms for users to extend the

                        authors describe that the Ogden Richards' semiotic triangle "shows that,
                        although written or spoken symbols (words) cannot completely capture the
                        essence of a reference (thought) or of a referent (thing), there is a
                        correspondence among them. Either a word or an object can inspire a thought,
                        and people may endeavor to express their thoughts with words or by
                        identifying objects in the world. The relationship between a word and a
                        thing is indirect, however. The link can be completed only when an
                        interpreter (usually a person) processes the word, which invokes a
                        corresponding thought, and then links that thought to a thing in the world
                        (the “referent”). This diagram is seductive in its simplicity." </para>

                            implying a one-to-one relationship between each pair of members in the
                            triangle, this simple diagram masks hidden complexity. Ogden and
                            Richards alluded to this complexity by the dotted line between a symbol
                            and a referent, indicating that the link between a symbol and a referent
                            can only be made indirectly through an interpreter, but the notion that
                            a symbol does—or could—refer to a single thought and that a thought
                            does—or could—refer to a single referent is a fallacy. Thus, it has been
                            historically recognized that multiple terms may refer to the same object
                            or idea, a single term may refer ambiguously to more than one object or
                            idea, and terms may be confusing because they are out of date. It is
                            within this context that we seek solutions to improve our ability to

                        While hierarchical information is paramount, the inclusion of additional
                        definitional knowledge can help maintain and correctly place concepts within
                        the appropriate hierarchy. Allowing computers to use this additional
                        information can aid in properly placing concepts in hierarchies that
                        developers did not originally add to a concept.</para>
                    <para>When content modelers add new content to a terminology, the relationships
                        they create are sometimes called stated relationships. These stated
                        relationships help to give concepts a formal definition and can be used to
                        correctly place a concept in new hierarchies the content modeler did not
                        originally assign. In large terminologies, correctly adding all the possible
                        valid hierarchical relationships can be difficult as it requires the content
                        modeler to think of all the possible parents. By adding the additional
                        information, like Finding Site in the example below, additional hierarchical
                        relationships can be inferred.<figure>

        <para>Terminology systems are increasingly critical components for achieving

            terminologies in achieving interoperability for the purposes of advancing patient care
            is well documented. Ideally, these clinical terminology standards intend to provide
            rules to allow for the exchange, integration, and management of electronic clinical
            information. The federal government recognizes the benefit of standard terminologies and
            promotes their development and use. The

            their use through federal payment policies. [3]</para>
        <para>Terminology standards cover different domains of clinical and nonclinical content
            relevant to the EHR, and serve various purposes. Currently, no single terminology or
            classification system contains everything that is needed for the medical record.
            Terminology systems typically consist of the following elements: </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Coded Concepts – the discrete units of knowledge managed within the
                    terminology. They typically consist of numeric codes and textual preferred

                <para>Concept Hierarchies – the logical organization of concepts into parent-child
                    and ancestor-descendant relationships that express the semantics of
                    generalization and specialization. The hierarchical organization of a
                    terminology may be explicitly expressed through stored parent-child and
                    ancestor-descendant links, or it may be implicitly expressed through the logical
                    definitions of individual concepts that a computer can use to infer parent-child
                    and ancestor-descendant relationships. </para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para>New applications and new medical knowledge constantly call for expansion and
            enhancement of existing terminologies. However, since terminology systems are often
            non-static, incomplete, and under-specified, inconsistencies may be introduced. </para>
        <para>While many of these challenges are related to terminology evolution, others may be
            related to the design of the standard clinical terminologies themselves. Cimino notably
            described the challenges of concept orientation, completeness, correctness, currency,
            granularity, and redundancy when designing re-usable medical terminologies. Today a
            menagerie of inconsistent and overlapping terminology models hinders efforts that try to
            store and analyze encoded clinical data. The scope of content covered in terminologies
            varies from focusing on a very specific domain to covering multiple domains.</para>

        <para>LOINC® is a global clinical terminology developed by the Regenstrief Institute to
            standardize the identification of health measurements, observations, and documents,
            addressing the challenge of inconsistent local codes in electronic health data exchange.
            It provides unique identifiers and names for a wide range of clinical observations—not
            just laboratory tests—enabling interoperability across health IT systems by pairing
            LOINC® codes for observations with result values, often using SNOMED CT® for the latter.
            Over the years, LOINC® has expanded beyond laboratory data and is maintained by
            committees focused on Laboratory, Clinical, and Radiology areas.
            [4]<?oxy_comment_end mid="25"?><?oxy_comment_end?></para>
        <para>Regenstrief continues to update LOINC® and publish twice-yearly releases. New concepts
            are added to LOINC® based on submissions from end users. The current version contains
            more than 99,000 terms covering the full scope of laboratory testing (chemistry,
            microbiology, molecular pathology, …etc.) and a broad range of clinical measurements
            (e.g., vital signs, ECG, patient-reported outcomes, …etc.). In addition to distributing
            the terminology, Regenstrief makes available at no cost a variety of supporting tools
            and resources, including the Regenstrief LOINC® Mapping Assistant (RELMA®) and online
            search application.</para>
        <para>LOINC® uses a semantic data model containing six major and up to four minor attributes
            to create fully-specified names for concepts. The major attributes of the LOINC® name
            are:</para>

        </orderedlist>
        <para>The atomic elements that make up each LOINC® term name are called “Parts” and are also
            assigned identifiers. The combination of attribute values produce term names that are
            [intended to be] detailed enough to distinguish among similar observations. Of the six
            attributes, only the method is optional and used only when necessary to distinguish
            among clinical important differences. </para>
        <para>“A fully specified test result or clinical observation can be described formally with

        <para>Over time, LOINC® has not only grown in size, but also developed additional data
            structures and content around its main codes for individual observations. The LOINC®
            release contains a basic hierarchy that organizes LOINC® codes into a set of is-a
            relationships. LOINC® now has a detailed model for representing enumerated collections
            of observations, such as laboratory panels (complete blood count), assessment
            instruments (e.g., PHQ-9), data sets (National Trauma Data Standard), and forms (e.g.,
            U.S. Standard Birth Certificate). This content is published in a special release
            artifact called the LOINC® Database, which is released twice a year (usually in June and
            December). LOINC® also has a detailed model for connecting observation terms to
            structured answer lists. These answer lists can be defined by extension or intension and
            linked to observation terms with different types (e.g., example, preferred, normative).
            This content is published in the LOINC® Answer List File, which is updated alongside the
            latest LOINC Database, and includes mappings to other terminologies such as SNOMED CT®,
            where they exist. LOINC® now also publishes the atomic elements (called Parts) that make
            up each LOINC® term name. The LOINC® Part File includes the Part identifiers and names,
            links between Parts and LOINC® terms, and mappings from LOINC® Parts to other
            terminologies such as SNOMED CT® and RxNorm where they exist.</para>

                        code, often leading to inconsistent code selection. [6,7] These
                        inconsistencies frequently arise from differences in choosing attributes
                        like method, scale, or property, and are compounded by limited education and
                        training on LOINC® coding. [8-10] A College of American Pathologists (CAP)
                        survey of 90 laboratories found that nearly 20% of LOINC® codes selected for
                        common coagulation tests were incorrect, with the most frequent errors

                <para>Since 2004, the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) has maintained a
                    specialized extension namespace, registered with the International Health
                    Terminology Standards Development Organization (IHTSDO), to develop clinical
                    terminology that supports electronic health record (EHR) deployment at its
                    hospitals and clinics. This terminology work, driven by the practical
                    documentation needs of Nebraska clinicians, has been integrated into multiple
                    EHR systems, including PHAMIS, IDX-GE, and Epic. In 2014, a collaborative
                    project between IHTSDO and the Regenstrief Institute began harmonizing
                    laboratory data standards between LOINC® and SNOMED CT®, resulting in the
                    publication of SNOMED CT® expressions for about 13,000 laboratory LOINC®
                    observables by 2017. UNMC incorporated these into its SNOMED CT® extension,
                    using LOINC® names and organizing them within the SNOMED CT® Observable
                    hierarchy, while also creating “grouper” concepts to enhance clinical navigation
                    and support common laboratory and pathology queries. The resulting ontology,
                    which includes both stated and inferred relationships, is now available for
                    review and feedback from the informatics community.

        <para>Since its origin as the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) in 1965, SNOMED
            has evolved significantly in both content and structure, growing from about 15,000 to

            medical concepts, but later versions, starting with SNOMED RT®, adopted a more formal
            description logic approach, which continues in SNOMED CT®. This evolution reflects
            increasing rigor and complexity in representing clinical knowledge, as seen in the

        <para>RxNorm is a terminology for human clinical drugs in the U.S., representing drug
            properties such as ingredient, strength, and dose form, maintained by the National

            (UMLS).</para>
        <para>RxNorm provides normalized clinical drug names and relationships between those names
            and common drug vocabularies for the purpose of easing the exchange of clinical drug
            information between systems that use different drug vocabularies. Every concept in
            RxNorm is given a unique Concept Unique Identifiers (RxCUIs). The names and codes from
            the common drug vocabularies are then linked to that RxCUI.</para>

        <para>A collaborative effort between SNOMED CT® and LOINC® has been renewed to create a

            has been particularly attractive for the SNOMED CT®'s polyhierarchal structure and
            inferencing capabilities and would support a greater compatibility and interoperability
            between SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm, despite different formalisms and tools for their

            <para>While RxNorm meets most of the Desiderata’s requirements, there are a few that are
                not met. Of particular importance is the lack of Description Logics. Use of a
                Description Logics reasoner can help in overcoming important drawbacks of
                multi-axial systems: (1) the capability of detecting semantic equivalence of
                syntactically different expressions, and (2) the automated classification of
                concepts in a hierarchy. Another important component is RxNorm is not a global
                standard as its development and main use is in the U.S. where it is a nationally
                recognized standard, i.e. Meaningful Use. </para>

                extensible ontology of drug products, their ingredients and biological activity to
                enable comparative effectiveness and allow researchers to query National Drug Codes
                (NDCs) in multiple ways. Bone et al. go on to say the following:</para>

                    an OWL file that implements and defines the classes necessary to model these
                    entities. A separate file contains an instance-level prototype in OWL that
                    demonstrates the feasibility of this approach to representing NDCs and the
                    RxCUIs and the processes of managing them by retrieving and representing several
                    individual NDCs, both active and inactive, and the RxCUIs to which they are
                    connected. We also demonstrate how historic information about these identifiers
                    in DrOn can be easily retrieved using a simple SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query
                    Language (SPARQL).</emphasis>[21]</para>

        <para>A report in the 2016 Yearbook of Medical Informatics defines terminology as “a system
            of concepts with assigned identifiers and human language terms, typically involving some
            kind of semantic hierarchy. Some systems may support the assignment of multiple terms,
            or synonyms, to a given concept; these may include terms in multiple natural languages,
            such as English or Dutch.” [23] This definition implies that knowledge representation
            for a terminology system may not always be based on a strict defining hierarchy. The
            advantage, or disadvantage, of such an approach is that the terminology, such as LOINC®
            for instance, might appear to be rather intuitive and human-readable and comprehensible.
            However, when delving into complex use cases, a lack of formal defining structure may
            reveal that it is difficult to understand the precise meaning of the terminological
            representations and that use of a system such as LOINC® may differ widely amongst
            humans. Further exacerbating potential variability is the heterogeneous behavior of
            tools implemented to reason with terminological structures. [24] </para>
        <para>The field of Knowledge Representation and “Description Logics” was developed out of
            the attempt to formally define “intuitive representations” with a formal semantics to
            establish a common ground for human and tool interoperability. Knowledge representation
            involves the design of formalisms for expressing knowledge about a particular domain and
            focuses on representing and characterizing classes of objects and relationships between
            them. An ideal state terminology that relies on description logics may invoke more
            formal semantic relationships between and among concepts. Use of a Description Logics
            reasoner can help in overcoming important drawbacks of multi-axial systems and other
            non-standard, distinct formalisms: (1) the capability of detecting semantic equivalence
            of syntactically different expressions, and (2) the automated classification of concepts
            in a hierarchy.

            <title>Dialect</title>
            <para>Merriam-Webster's Dictionary defines a dialect as &quot;a regional variety of
                language distinguished by features of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation from
                other regional varieties and constituting together with them a single
                language&quot;. Two common differences between dialects deal with spelling variants
                and phrases that have alternate meanings. An example of a spelling variant would be
                &quot;Anesthetic&quot; in the US dialect versus &quot;Anaesthetic&quot; in the
                British dialect. The same word in one dialect can mean have a different meaning in
                another, for example

            <title>Cross Cutting Concerns</title>
            <para>The language used to describe a component must be concordant with the underlying
                semantics of the object being identified. Therefore, there needs to be guidelines in
                place to ensure only correct terms are associated with an object in an IKM solution. </para>
            <para>Having a consistent naming convention defined will assist with textual queries to
                identify duplicates when concepts are primitive and not able to be fully defined
                using relationships within the IKM. Having a consistent way of representing Fully
                Specified Names will alleviate the issue of users creating duplicate concepts like
                &quot;Disorder of immune function&quot; and &quot;Immune function
                disorder&quot;.</para>
            <para>Consistent naming is also important to support effective retrieval. For example,
                the SNOMED CT® concept 386560004 |Glasgow coma score finding (finding)| has 13
                children all with the string Glasgow coma scale instead of Glasgow coma score. </para>
            <para>Another common issue is to add a synonym to a concept that is more specific than
                the concept itself. A concept should only have synonyms that accurately represent a
                concept and not any of its children. If a synonym has a more specific meaning, a new
                concept should be created.</para>

                    Requirements</title>
                <para>For a search engine to retrieve meaningful results, it must be able to
                    understand common usages of everyday jargon, similar to how synonyms are used to
                    help broaden the way to express the same word. This section describes several
                    strategies used to help with a query.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Word variants</emphasis> – Similar to synonyms, word
                    variants are used to express the same word. While synonyms are explicitly
                    created as a term to describe a concept (for example, SNOMED CT®'s "Heart
                    attack" and "Myocardial infarction"), word variants are utilized during
                    searching to assist in finding the correct concept, rather than explicitly
                    creating the term. Hypothetical example - if "kidney failure" is a term created
                    for a concept, a word variant of 'renal' could be created for 'kidney'. Instead
                    of explicitly creating a separate term of "renal failure", this word variant
                    could be utilized during searching to find all concepts that have the explicit
                    term of "kidney failure" when a user enters "renal failure" by replacing "renal"
                    with "kidney". This would create the burden of creating all possible variant
                    terms for a given word.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Misspellings</emphasis> – Certain terms are more
                    commonly misspelled when searching over healthcare descriptions. The ability for
                    a search mechanism to recognize them and to search over both the correct and
                    incorrect spellings will help to identify the correct concept. For example,
                    perineal vs peroneal and aphagia vs aphasia. </para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Word order</emphasis> – Terms can be combined in
                    different ways to mean the same synonym. The ability to search over a term in
                    varying order of phrases is important. For example, Disorder of the eye vs Eye
                    disorder.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Components query</emphasis> – The importance of this
                    searching strategy comes into play when a certain focus is desired for the
                    search result. For example, in LOINC®, there may be circumstances where a
                    certain axis is desired for the search. Similarly, a certain hierarchy may be
                    desired when searching in SNOMED CT®. For example, "cold" is a synonym of common
                    cold (a disorder) in SNOMED CT®, and also exists as "cold sensation quality" (a
                    qualifier value). By allowing users to limit the search criteria (disorder vs.
                    qualifier), the most appropriate query result will be returned to the
                    user.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Active and inactive</emphasis> – Concepts and terms will
                    come in and out of use over time. This is often indicated by an active/inactive
                    designation. In order to properly return concepts/terms that are active, query
                    parameters must contain a parameter to designate if the query result
                    should/should not return active and inactive concepts or terms.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Regular Expressions</emphasis> - Regular expression or
                    regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. This pattern
                    would allow a user to retrieve results based on a certain pattern. For example
                    "a|b*" would return all "a", "b" and other b's that fits the pattern such as
                    "bb", "bbb", "bab", etc. Since the depth and breadth of regular expression is
                    beyond the scope of this document, various syntaxes, usage and explanation can
                    be found in many resources such as <link xlink:href="https://regexr.com/"
                    />.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Grouping Results by hierarchy</emphasis> - This search
                    requirement can be thought of as a complement to "components query". After
                    casting a wide net, results could be a bag of various terms (common cold vs.
                    feeling cold) that may be cumbersome for users to sift through if it is not
                    organized in an orderly fashion. Therefore, if results are placed together in a
                    logical grouping, it would assist the user in finding the appropriate query
                    result. For example, in SNOMED CT®, it may be worthwhile to group results by
                    hierarchy (disorder vs. procedures) to allow a user to look for a result in a
                    desired domain or in RxNorm where all Ingredient results are grouped separately
                    from Semantic Clinical Drug results.</para>

        <title>Definitional</title>
        <para>We, as humans, are able to express individual concepts and expand on just the name of
            the concept, because we are able to associate certain characteristics to individual
            concepts to further describe itself, as well as establishing connections or
            relationships between concepts. Once concepts have a meaning beyond just a name, and
            have relationships to other meaningful concepts, then reasoning can occur. </para>
        <para>While the purpose of Language is to provide necessary vocabulary to express various
            domains of medicine, the purpose of the Definitions are to expand on just a name to go
            with an idea - single concepts with a name by itself adds no value. In other words, a
            system must be capable of capturing not just the words of the concept, but also provide
            a mechanism to express characteristics of that concept (it has the color white [assuming
            color and white are already defined]) and relationships between concepts (it is a
            beta-blocker). Additionally, once relationships of meaningful concepts are established,
            reasoning can occur (beta-blocker is used to treat high blood pressure, therefore, it
            treats high blood pressure).</para>
        <para>Once a system is able to 'digest' the meaning of concepts, it can begin to utilize
            logic to conduct reasoning. In the field of computer science, the study of Description
            Logic is to represent the domain, then using these concepts to specify properties of
            objects and individuals occuring in the domain. Additionally, another feature of
            Description Logic is the capability to conduct reasoning on represented knowledge. The
            goal of this section is to first provide a primer to those who may not be fully immersed
            in the study of description logic, then an introduction to IKM designs to allow for a
            robust representation and relationships of concepts, followed by topics or concerns from
            our IKM developers and contributors that necessitate a discussion on why these concerns
            could affect a system to conduct reasoning properly or successfully. </para>

            <title>Description Logic</title>
            <para>Description Logic consists of a family of formal knowledge representation language
                that implements mathematical logic to support formal expressions, reasoning, and
                formal proof. It is typically more expressive than propositional logic, which only
                deals with fixed truth values, which may or may not be true
                (<?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190305T155849-0700" comment="Should be &quot;e.g.&quot; instead of &quot;i.e.&quot;  Same for example below for books or temperature." id="cpw_mqc_1hb" flag="done"?><?oxy_comment_start author="erhwang" timestamp="20190307T083716-0700" comment="fixed" parentID="cpw_mqc_1hb" flag="done" mid="49"?>e.g.

                variables to represent 'things' (e.g. books or temperature). However, it is less
                expressive than first-order logic, which assumes the world contains Objects,
                Relations and Functions, allows variables and can quantify over non-logical objects.
                The main design principle of Description Logics is its balance between expressivity
                and computational complexity to suit different applications, with medical ontology
                modeling being one use case. </para>
            <para>DLs provides a way to model the domain by providing three entities: concepts,
                roles and individual names: <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>

            <para>Instead of fully describing the state of a domain, as one would with a database,
                DLs contain axioms, or statements. These axioms capture partial knowledge about the
                situation that the ontology is describing, and there may be many different states of
                the world that are consistent with the ontology. [25] With a proper modeling of
                formal semantics, DLs allows humans and computer systems to unambiguously exchange
                ontologies without losing their meaning, and also provides the capability to infer
                (reason) additional information from given facts in order compute a conclusion. </para>

            <para>Today's health care terminology standards encompass methods, terminologies, and
                specifications for the exchange, storage, and retrieval of information associated
                with health care systems. These standards contain terminologies and concepts that
                are used in medical records to describe patient symptoms, lab results, prescription
                medications, etc. In today's health care industry, the standard approach to
                integrating multiple disparate health data sources is to conduct mapping, a manual
                process that attempts to associate data to different systems for exchanging patient
                information and other data. Mapping, while pragmatically actionable, is prone to
                information loss and errors.</para>
            <para>Preserving the meaning of information when exchanging electronic health record
                data (i.e., semantic interoperability) is critical for delivering safe patient care
                and leveraging standards-based clinical decision support. Given that individuals
                often receive health care from more than one health system, integration of data from
                multiple sources is needed to ‘view’ a patient’s complete health record and avoid
                erroneous clinical decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information, such as
                decisions that lead to performing unnecessary tests or giving a patient a drug to
                which they are known to be allergic. To date, the strategy for achieving semantic
                interoperability between the clinical systems of the Department of Defense (DoD) and
                the Veterans Administration (VA) has been to ‘map’ millions of data elements used in
                the respective EHRs to standard terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and
                RxNorm). However, ‘round trip testing’ of the mapped concepts has identified
                problems with the quality of the mappings for bidirectional use. New strategies are
                required to achieve semantic interoperability to support safe patient care, both
                before and after the two organizations start using a single vendor for their
                electronic health record systems. The use of logical definitions and terminology
                system extensions to manage concepts used in the delivery of care can overcome key
                challenges with the mapping strategy.</para>

                <title>Mapping is Operational, but Incomplete</title>
                <para>Despite the fact that mapping is plagued by challenges (e.g., being out of
                    date, not scalable, inconsistent, overly complex, incoherent, unstandardized),
                    it still serves an operational need. Current data standards hinder true
                    interoperability, so mapping allows disparate organizations to share and use at
                    least some of their clinical data across health systems. In this section, we
                    will highlight some of the immediate benefits that mapping provides from an
                    operational perspective. Subsequently, we will discuss the challenges associated
                    with mapping. These challenges may ultimately compromise patient safety and
                    clinical decisions. </para>

                    <para>Mapping is an approach to share data; unfortunately, mapping at each step
                        in the data exchange process creates additional opportunities for error and
                        for loss of information that may lead to a patient’s harm. SNOMED CT® and
                        other meaningful use standards are frequently used as targets of this
                        mapping, and their use is mandated as part of the Meaningful Use
                        regulations. Tables 1 and 2 below show how equivalent concepts in two
                        different care settings leads to information loss when they are mapped to
                        SNOMED CT® because SNOMED CT® does not represent the equivalent meaning.

                        broader than or narrower than or equivalent, and the SNOMED CT® Concept
                        column represents the concept to which the local concept has been mapped.
                        The Meaning Lost column describes the information lost due to mapping
                        because an equivalent match of the local concept is not found in SNOMED CT.

                    highlighted issues with completeness, correctness, and redundancy in the UMLS
                    Metathesaurus, particularly in its coverage of disease concepts. The UMLS does
                    not necessarily look at semantic equivalence of concepts across or within
                    terminologies, rather focusing on lexical equivalence. A good example of this is
                    how the UMLS has represented content from SNOMED CT® in the pharmaceutical
                    product and substance hierarchies. SNOMED CT® has separate concepts to represent
                    the substance that makes up a pharmaceutical product, for example acetaminophen,
                    and a higher level concept in the pharmaceutical product hierarchy that is used
                    to group products together (all products that contain acetaminophen). In the
                    UMLS these concepts are grouped together under a single UMLS Concept Unique
                    Identifier (CUI).</para>
                <para>These issues related to integrating clinical content have a direct impact on
                    patient safety and point to the need to be able to consistently represent and
                    encode clinical data and observations. Therefore, quality assurance is an
                    indispensable part of the terminology management lifecycle. A central limitation
                    of integrating controlled medical terminologies is that they often lack any
                    formal model to denote the relationships among constituent data elements. </para>
                <para>Recently, however, development teams for SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm have
                    partnered to promote interoperability. Developers can now leverage SNOMED CT®’s
                    representation model for the building blocks of LOINC®, and a new drug model in
                    SNOMED CT® facilitates extensions and consistency to RxNorm. Bodenreider et al.
                    wrote about the recent collaboration: “while this evolution leads to greater
                    compatibility and interoperability, integration of SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and
                    RxNorm still requires mappings among the three terminologies. Moreover, these
                    three terminologies use different formalisms and tools for their representation,
                    have their own release cycles and versioning mechanisms, which makes their
                    seamless integration non trivial, if at all possible.”

The NLM, also, in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, hosts the Value Set Authority Center (VSAC). The VSAC aims to provide lists of values, codes, and names (i.e., value sets) from standard clinical terminologies to represent clinical concepts.

Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)
Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) created OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to inform the appropriate use of observational healthcare databases for studying the effects of medical products. ATHENA is used to harmonize disparate coding systems—with minimal information loss—to a standardized vocabulary. The Standard Vocabulary is a foundational tool that enables transparent and consistent content across disparate observational databases, and serves to support the OHDSI research community in conducting efficient and reproducible observational research.
OHDSI categorizes source terminology concepts in three ways:
Standard Concept: &quot;official&quot; concepts used to represent unique clinical entities in the CDM.
Classification Concept: have a hierarchical relationship to Standard Concepts and can be used to query for Standard Concepts using the records of the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table. However, they cannot appear in the Data Tables.
Source Concept: all remaining Concepts that are not Standard or Classification Concepts 
OHDSI&apos;s Standard Vocabulary relies heavily on mapping non-standard concepts to the Standard Concepts. &quot;"?></para><?oxy_comment_end?>

                <title>Komet's Approach to Interoperability</title>
                <para>What’s needed is a semantically normalized information model (i.e., Komet)
                    with an appropriate separation of concerns in regard to the informatics
                    architectural layers. Such a model is critical for the success of a number of
                    forward-thinking healthcare initiatives. Komet does not map one terminology
                    system to another and instead integrates terminology content (LOINC®, SNOMED
                    CT®, RxNorm, etc.) from its native format into a common Komet format. Once the
                    content is in Komet, where equivalency is determined through various methods,
                    concepts of the same idea are aggregated. For example, Gentamycin from SNOMED
                    CT® is the same as Gentamycin from LOINC®, and is also the same Gentamycin from
                    RxNorm. The end result from this process is the creation of a Komet concept that
                    is devoid of any source information (but will have traceability), and is exposed
                    to the user to view, use, and extend. In the Gentamycin example, a user will
                    find a concept that is devoid of any source information and will not need to
                    know if this is the SNOMED CT®/LOINC®/RxNorm Gentamycin that needs to be
                    selected. Komet concepts are identified using a Universally Unique Identifier
                    (UUID).</para>

                    <title> The Komet Solution</title>
                    <para>The new approach to data integration involves the use of description logic
                        to model and manage concepts from standard terminologies to support clinical
                        care. Instead of mapping an existing local code or term to a standard code
                        with the goal of creating semantic equivalence, challenges created by
                        mapping were avoided by directly representing concepts using standard codes
                        or logical expressions that conform to a description logic model. We
                        described the strategy for representing ‘things’ (i.e. meanings) about
                        patient care using existing single LOINC®, SNOMED®, and RxNorm concepts,
                        computable logical expressions based on LOINC®, SNOMED CT®, or RxNorm that
                        are added to extensions managed by an organization, organization specific
                        identifiers to support specific local needs, and by adding ‘names’ (i.e.,
                        new dialect-specific synonyms) to already-existing ‘things’. Finally,
                        ‘alternate identifiers’ for LOINC®, SNOMED®, or RxNorm concepts are useful
                        for integrating historical data so source terms (linked to alternative
                        identifiers) are accurately represented using standard concepts defined
                        using description logic. LOINC®, SNOMED CT®, and RxNorm form the foundation
                        of Komet given that they are meaningful use standards, where when integrated
                        together, represent the breadth of information necessary for clinical data
                        representation. Komet is not intended to compete with existing standards and
                        processes, and does not redistribute content.
