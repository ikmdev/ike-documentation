            <para>In today’s current state, <emphasis role="bold">Laboratory Real-World Data (RWD)
                    is of remarkably low-quality </emphasis>which affects quality of care.Currently,
                standard test results and test information are encoded both inconsistently and
                incompletely. The current laboratory data standards alone (e.g., Logical Observation
                Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®)) do not provide the level of detail or
                precision needed for the advanced analytics that power the clinical, regulatory,
                public health, and coverage determination decisions. </para>
            <para>As a result of these low-quality data, patient safety is at risk, quality of care
                diminishes, and accuracy of test results come into question. Simultaneously, this
                low-quality data has negatively impacted operational efficiency within both federal
                and private sectors. Examples of negative effects of federal agencies are seen

            <title>Proposed Solution</title>
            <para>In order to address these gaps in data, the Systemic Harmonization and
                Interoperability Enhancement for Laboratory Data (SHIELD) Collaborative Community
                (CC) curated a device extension that creates interoperability between different
                systems. The extension was designed to be an authoritative source to educate
                end-users on populating their data dictionaries. The device extension will provide
                guidance and interact across systems on which data standards codes (e.g.
                LOINC®/Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Term (SNOMED CT®)) are to be
                used for specific tests and/or devices. This source, designed by the CC, <emphasis
                    role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">will link the laboratory analyzer with the
                        necessary information to support the comparison of test results without
                        switching laboratory codes, thus, increasing data
                    quality</emphasis></emphasis>.</para>
            <para>The device extension is <emphasis role="bold">intended to serve as a database that
                    improves the quality and interoperability of laboratory data</emphasis>. The
                extension does this by utilizing Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) to link individual
                In-Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) devices to a database that contains the test’s metadata,
                including units of measurement and data standard codes. It will provide insightful
                guidance on which data standard (e.g. LOINC®/SNOMED CT®) codes should be used on
                specific tests and devices. It will also enable linking laboratory analyzers with
                information to support the comparison of test results using the same laboratory
                codes. </para>
            <para> Our device extension was designed to address gaps in the current system. The
                extension is intended to be <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">a reliable
                        reference source to inform end users how to populate data
                        dictionaries</emphasis></emphasis>. This reduces the variance in laboratory
                data representation and will also provide laboratories with guidance on LOINC/SNOMED
                CT code usage for specific tests. This extension also <emphasis role="bold"
                        ><emphasis role="italic">enables the linking of laboratory devices through
                        Unique Device Identifier (UDIs) with supporting contextual information to
                        enable deeper insights and accurate comparison of
                    results</emphasis></emphasis>.</para>
            <para>These two benefits directly contribute to a dramatic enhancement of advanced
                analytical capabilities across a variety of mediums. Additional detail and
                consistent encoding of test results empower artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms
                to uncover deeper health insights that aid in treatment.</para>

            <title>Development and Implementation Progress</title>
            <para>Data interoperability begins with the ability to represent data in a uniformed way
                with quality standards that are adhered to by the community. SNOMED CT® and LOINC®
                are two international interoperability standards that both work to communicate
                clinical data information, LOINC® focusing on clinical and laboratory observations
                and SNOMED CT® focusing on clinical terminology for diagnoses, procedures, findings,
                and more. </para>
            <para>LOINC® and SNOMED CT® signed an agreement in October 2022 to collaborate the work
                between the two standards. The shared effort worked to eliminate duplicative data
                between the standards and integrate shared information to create an extension of
                SNOMED CT® with LOINC® knowledge standards included. The collaborative use of these
                terminologies will provide defined and accessible formats and concepts to represent
                data captured in laboratories or clinical settings.</para>
            <para>The LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® Browser builds on the capabilities of the SNOMED
                CT® Browser by providing visibility to LOINC® data through search or query. The
                impact the agreement has on the interoperability community spans across the
                healthcare IT industry by bridging two organizations who are leaders in terminology
                standards and interoperability. </para>
            <para>The collaborative efforts of the LOINC® Ontology SNOMED CT® Browser have produced
                a suite of increased functionality and tools that enable increased interoperability

            <para>The SNOMED LOINC® Collaborative Agreement has made significant strides in
                technical communications by providing comprehensive documentation on the processes
                used to link the two data standards. The ontology browser homepage offers an
                introductory technical explanation, detailing the content inclusions, modeling
                guidelines, concept/attribute representation, and future steps for improving the
                browser. This documentation is crucial for both technical and non-technical
                audiences, offering insights into the collaborative processes and technical efforts,
                and allowing individuals to understand the development and align their own
                implementations accordingly. The availability of this information ensures
                transparency and facilitates a deeper understanding of the integration
                efforts.
            </para>
            <para>Looking forward, the collaboration faces challenges in integrated knowledge communications and ensuring end-user adoption. The virtual location for the LOINC®-SNOMED CT® Ontology Browser showcases the progress made but lacks clear communication of the overarching goals. Engaging the community and building trust is essential to advancing healthcare information technology, and this can be achieved by enhancing understanding and support. The device extension will utilize the most recent updates published to the LOINC®-SNOMED CT® Ontology Browser. The ability of the device extension to utilize relevant standards from the source enhances effective communication strategies, which are critical for promoting tool adoption, requiring tailored messaging for different end-user segments. The end-user adoption strategy must balance detailed technical guidance for experts with non-technical communications that highlight the benefits and address specific pain points. This dual approach, including user guides, collaboration forums, and feedback channels, will support operational collaboration and encourage broader user engagement with the tools.</para>

            <title>Patient Journey Use Case (Emerging Infectious Disease)</title>
            <para>The Emerging Infectious Disease Use Case, depicted in Figure 1, showcases the
                details of a patient's journey within medical facilities and processes taking place
                during an emerging infectious disease, covering an array of processes from symptom
                recognition to final diagnosis. As seen below, the primary patient journey is
                denoted by blue. This is where a patient who has been either notified of an exposure
                (Figure 1, Box 1) or begins to develop symptoms that align with that of an emerging
                infectious disease (Figure 1, Box 2) is interacting with the various points of care.
                This journey covers the patient's whole journey within the healthcare ecosystem,
                culminating in a diagnosis of chronic post-infectious disease (Figure 1, Box 1 –
                9).</para>
            <para>To fully understand the patient care journey, the individual sub-cycles (black in
                    <emphasis role="italic">Figure 2</emphasis>) denote the potential processes
                where a patient interacts with different care delivery individuals, systems, and/or
                organizations. These sub-cycles are utilized to collect data, inform decision-making
                for the patient outcome, and/or further exchange data to improve the healthcare
                ecosystem's understanding and diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases. This
                results in specific secondary processes that interconnect between the patient
                journey and differing state/federal health organizations that are responsible for
                the reporting and diagnostic device monitoring for public health reporting (Yellow,
                    <emphasis role="italic">Figure 1, </emphasis>Box 12, 16, 22).</para>
            <para>Our device extension was designed to interconnect these sub cycles, which
                correspond to health IT platforms or systems, to inform individual patient care
                outcomes and public health reporting. It can support the increased interconnectivity
                between healthcare ecosystem entities. These entities, often terminologists, are
                responsible for creating and extending relevant terminology subsets or modules.
                Supported by our Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) environment, this procedure
                enables authoring a new extension record and integrates the newly formed terminology
                subsets. Figure 2 showcases how an IKM-powered ecosystem would interact with
                patients and evolve based on the advances in clinical diagnostics during an
                infectious disease outbreak.</para>
            <para>Like Figure 1, Figure 2 showcases a patient's journey through the healthcare system. For example, if a patient needs to order an Over-The-Counter (OTC) emerging infectious disease test kit, the patient must use a patient portal that has been enabled with the appropriate listing of tests. Figure 2 showcases that certain functions are only actionable if the current Information Technology (IT) Systems, relevant to the career journey, and key players across the organization update the existing health terminology gaps currently enacted and affect patient care. Utilizing the IKM environment, our device extension provides the functionality to efficiently reconcile these gaps in standards that have been discovered as a result of:</para>

            <para>Secondary process documentation has been provided below to enhance understanding
                of these process flows and showcase the high-level process documentation of our
                device extension. These process flows dive further into the patient journey and
                highlight the unique data transfers that occur while detailing the effective use of
                the device extension in Symptom Surveillance, which overviews the patient data
                relating to acute symptoms, including questionaries, reporting data, and recording
                negative symptoms, to highlight risk and protocol. These secondary processes, in
                addition, highlight the advanced flow of data, expanding how Testing Recommendations occur and how Comparator Testing will take place. The following sections showcase the device extension’s ability to interconnect different large-scale organization databases and the potential for device interoperability.</para>

                <title>Sub-Cycle 1: Symptom Surveillance</title>
                <para>The first secondary process documentation highlights the data processes and
                    flows that occur when individual patient data, along its emerging infectious
                    disease journey, integrates with the larger symptom surveillance ecosystem. As
                    individual data is obtained at the various collection points throughout
                    diagnosis, testing, and treatment processes, this information can be directly
                    aggregated into the larger data repository/lakes that will enable public health
                    entities to research and analyze macro-level data patterns and trends. These
                    data inputs into repositories can be supported by Integrated Knowledge Exchange
                    (IKE) solutions that enables seamless and lossless data transfer/exchange,
                    ensuring that data collection can be interoperable across disparate systems. As
                    this data is collected and assessed, new and/or unusual associated symptoms or
                    risk factors may be identified and reported, leading public health institutions
                    to update warnings and recommendations to clinical protocols to ensure the
                    collection of respective data is captured supporting the identification of these
                    newly identified facets. </para>
                <para>As public health institutions update this information, data collection
                    processes, such as questionnaires, need to be updated as well to coincide with
                    these updates. IKE solutions including Komet enable the modifications of
                    concepts directly in a single source that can be integrated across the various
                    data standards and implemented into data collection tools automatically. Once
                    the data collection methods are updated with new concept definitions and
                    specifications based on public health recommendations, future patient care
                    journeys have the functionality to capture the new information effectively and
                    securely to track performance in the future. <figure

                    may occur when administering an over-the-counter (OTC test to diagnose emerging
                    infectious disease(s)). In this sub-cycle, the individual patient data entering
                    the cycle are additional samples collected during the OTC test that serve as the
                    samples for Return to Lab (RTL) testing. RTL testing can be utilized for (1)
                    providing a “Gold Standard” test that has a higher rate of accuracy of
                    positivity/negativity to ensure accurate diagnosis and/or (2) post-market
                    surveillance of diagnostic testing performance for regulatory test decisions. An
                    RTL test may be completed with its results returned to a patient’s care journey,
                    with the test result data being integrated with data repositories/lakes and
                    available for public health research. In this research, it may be determined
                    that a diagnostic test should be fully approved from an investigative test to a
                    full market test, or public health institutions may report warnings, recommend
                    alterations to specifications, or even fully remove the test. Regardless of

                    additional patient data is collected and will be integrated into the larger RWD
                    repositories for use amongst the greater research and public health institutions
                    to assess patterns and trends. As that data is analyzed, new associated risk

                    diagnosis of an emerging infectious disease. </para>

                    consultation process, in the future to identify any additional factors that may
                    impact emerging infectious disease diagnosis. These new identifications can be
                    implemented into the healthcare information technology ecosystem using IKE
                    solutions, such as Komet, to modify concept data to include comorbidities within
