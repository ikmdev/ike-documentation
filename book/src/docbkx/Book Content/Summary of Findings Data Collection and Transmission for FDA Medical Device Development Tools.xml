    <title>Summary of Findings – Data Collection and Transmission for FDA Medical Device Development
        Tools</title>
    <section>
        <title>Purpose</title>
        <para>Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) is a multi-faceted approach to managing data and
            industry-wide knowledge. The primary goal of IKM in the healthcare sector is to advance
            patient health outcomes and organizational operations by improving the accuracy,
            quality, and interoperability of healthcare data. While a well-structured and
            comprehensive approach to IKM has the potential to positively impact the entire
            healthcare field, this deliverable will more specifically explore how IKM, Terminology
            Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar), and Komet can support the U.S. Food and Drug
            Administration’s (FDA’s) Medical Device Development Tools (MDDT) program and future
            submitters achieve their goals.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Background</title>
        <para>Over the last two years, our team has been working to develop an IKM reference
            implementation in the form of Komet. Komet is an application that supports comprehensive
            IKM of various healthcare terminology standards, like Logical Observation Identifiers
            Names and Codes (LOINC®), Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED
            CT®), and RxNorm. Komet employs Tinkar, a self-describing data structure and logical
            model, to provide a standardized and repeatable way of representing these various
            clinical terminology standards. Tinkar can transform data into both Protocol Buffers
            (Protobuf) and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data exchange
            standards to export and transmit data to other systems. To demonstrate the real-world
            applicability of Komet and IKM, our team explored how it could contribute to FDA goals. </para>
        <para>The MDDT program is an FDA initiative that aims to improve the process for device
            development, evaluation, and innovation by providing a standardized way to qualify the
            tools that medical devices use, including biomarker tests, various outcome measures,
            sensors, and more. The FDA medical device review and approval process has a variety of
            submission pathways, with a high-level overview of the overarching process outlined
            below in Figure 1.</para>

                IKM and Tinkar have the potential to support the MDDT program in two key

        <title>Komet as a Tool</title>
        <para>The MDDT program identifies four categories for submitted tools, including an “Other”
            category that assess (or supports assessment of) safety, effectiveness, or performance
            for a medical device [2]. Komet and our work could fall within this category as an
            open-source database and validation tool that ensures medical devices represent data,
            results, analytes, codes, and other critical information associated with devices in a
            standardized and accurate way. Komet could serve as a tool for a wide range of devices
            submitted to FDA via established pathways that would facilitate their review and
            approval:</para>
        <itemizedlist>

                    premarket submission process argue that their device is as safe and effective as
                    an existing and equivalent device that is already on the market. Using Komet and
                    Tinkar as a database could be used to demonstrate how both devices use the same,
                    or equivalent, codes to represent the various tests, analytes, results, and
                    values being captured [3].</para>

            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">FDA Premarket Approval (PMA) Submissions:</emphasis>
                    Devices in the PMA approval process possess substantial risks, support human
                    life, and/or are significantly involved in the prevention of negative health
                    outcomes in humans. Given this risk to human health and safety, Komet, Tinkar,
                    and our standardized representation of data across terminology standards could
                    validate that these devices can accurately transmit encoded information to a
                    variety of health information systems – including Electronic Health Records
                    (EHRs), Laboratory information Systems (LISs), and more – without the loss of
                    structure, meaning, or critical associated concepts. Komet can be used to ensure
                    these devices not only capture this information in their local systems but can
                    also transmit the information to other systems involved in the delivery of
                    patient care to demonstrate their ability to meet their intended purpose of
                    protecting human life [4].</para>

            <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">De Novo Submissions:</emphasis> Devices in the De Novo
                    approval process represent novel medical devices that lack a comparable existing
                    device to use as a point of comparison. These devices may not have existing ways
                    to be represented using terminology standards. Komet can support the creation of
                    a novel concept that can be used to reference the device submission while
                    collecting data and performing tests. The versioning features within Komet can
                    then be used to retire the temporary concept and update it to the official
                    concepts once they have been created. Using our Status, Time, Author, Module,
                    Path (STAMP) feature, the information associated with the temporary concept, the
                    date the concept was updated, the specific information that was changed when it
                    was updated to the official concept, and more would be stored and could be
                    easily visualized in the timeline feature. As these concepts continue to evolve,
                    Komet would continue to tie critical information to the most recent versions so
                    that historical context and data is not lost [5].</para>

        </itemizedlist>
        <para>As an MDDT, Komet could streamline the device review and approval process, reducing
            the time and resources needed to evaluate products accurately and efficiently. Komet
            would support a consistent and reliable assessment of other devices that reduces the
            time it takes to approve products. Once products have been approved, Komet could also
            continue to support standardized assessments of their safety with high-quality data
            collection and post-market surveillance that expedites 510(K) submissions, additional
            continued evaluation of devices, and more.</para>

        <title>Standardized Representation and Transmission of Device Data</title>
        <section>
            <title><anchor xml:id="Toc195710762"/>Discussion</title>
            <para>Our team explored the possibility and accuracy of end-users using Komet to author
                or edit an MDDT-related concept in Tinkar, transforming that representation into
                FHIR, and then transmitting that data to the various terminology standards to
                provide a way to represent these new tools when there is no formal or standardized
                concept [6]. We used IKM and Komet to develop Tinkar Terminology Change Sets and
                versioned knowledge graphs to provide Description Logic for terminology concept
                definitions. Even when there isn’t an official term or concept code, our Tinkar
                Change Sets provided an avenue to represent the MDDT tests, tools, and devices in a
                standardized way. This could serve as both a temporary solution, that could then be
                identified and mapped as an equivalent concept once Standards Developing
                Organizations (SDOs) release a formal term, or a permanent solution that could be
                submitted, validated, and released by SDOs. This document explores how IKM and
                Tinkar could support the lossless transmission of MDDT data, as depicted in figure
                2, between these devices and health systems, like EHRs and LISs, by normalizing the
                representation of devices, results, properties, and other pertinent
                information.</para>

                <para>An implementation of the Tinkar data model includes rich semantic details for
                    representing knowledge sources including, but not limited to, individual
                    concepts, synonyms and descriptions, relationships between terms, language and
                    dialect information, description logic axioms, and robust version history. This
                    rich, verbose data set contains complex and highly granular information.
                    Converting this data into a structured format like JavaScript Object Notation
                    (JSON) or Health Level Seven (HL7) FHIR can be challenging due to the intricacy
                    and depth of the data. Finding equivalence between source data elements and
                    Tinkar data elements correctly is crucial when converting Tinkar data into a
                    structured format. However, this process can be difficult and time-consuming,
                    particularly when dealing with complex data sets. Both JSON and HL7 FHIR have
                    their own limitations. For instance, JSON itself isn’t as performant as
                    alternative binary-JSON format representations and HL7 FHIR may not cover all
                    possible healthcare data exchange use cases and scenarios. These limitations can
                    pose challenges when trying to represent a rich, verbose data set like a Tinkar
                    database. Our team also found variation between different operating systems when
                    transforming Tinkar data to HL7 FHIR and JSON exports. </para>

                <title><anchor xml:id="Toc195702627"/>Lossy Representation</title>
                <para>Transforming Tinkar data into JSON or HL7 FHIR risks loss of information or
                    distortion of original data. Thus, maintaining data integrity during this
                    conversion process is a challenge. One significant challenge we faced in
                    implementation of the transform to FHIR is JSON does not support all data types
                    and structures that Tinkar and the source terminologies native formats
                    represent. Therefore, when transforming data from a Tinkar data representation
                    to JSON, there is a risk of losing information that does not fit into the JSON
                    structure. While JSON can handle some complex data structures, it can struggle
                    with deeply nested structures such as description logic axiom definitions for
                    concepts. Furthermore, during the transformation process, valuable metadata
                    (such as timestamps, authorship, or source information) may be lost. This can
                    reduce the utility and context of the transformed data, especially in the
                    context of the STAMP (status, time, author, module, and path) information in
                    Tinkar at the concept-level rather than at the code system level. </para>

                <title><anchor xml:id="Toc195702628"/>Version History Over Time</title>
                <para>Data standards are constantly evolving. The Tinkar data representation is
                    designed to retain each version of objects persisted as the object changes over
                    time, along with metadata indicating its version identifier, time of creation,
                    creating author, and branch of the version control system on which it was
                    created. Every version of each object must remain available for retrieval and
                    inspection. Keeping up with these changes and ensuring the converted data
                    remains compliant with the updated standards can be challenging, especially with
                    the lossy challenges as described above in the HL7 FHIR format. FHIR terminology
                    resources do not have a clean way of representing rich version history and
                    metadata; we are currently employing a strategy of combining a HL7 Code System
                    FHIR Resource and HL7 Provenance FHIR Resource together but there are details
                    lost such as the Module and Path and can only be exported at the Code System
                    level and not at the individual concept-level. </para>

            <section>
                <title><anchor xml:id="Toc195702629"/>Reasoning</title>
                <para>Lossy representation can lead to inefficient querying. If data is not
                    accurately represented, it can be more challenging to perform queries and gain
                    insights from the JSON data. If many concepts are updated in a Tinkar editing
                    environment, then the description logic reasoning can take a long time to
                    execute and have unintended consequences on the results. To mitigate these
                    challenges, it's crucial to plan and execute the transformation process
                    carefully, taking into consideration the data types, structures, and other
                    specific characteristics of the Tinkar database.</para>

        <title>Future Considerations</title>
        <para>As FDA continues to mature the MDDT program, Komet and IKM could support integration
            with the Laboratory Interoperability Device Reference (LIDR), a centralized repository
            of standardized codes for laboratory tests, devices, and analyzers. Incorporating LIDR
            into the MDDT process and requiring participants to transmit their LIDR record, using
            Komet and IKM, as part of the evaluation process could support further standardization
            of laboratory device representation [7]. </para>
        <para>In the coming months, our team plans to unequivocally demonstrate that IKM, and more
            specifically Komet, provides the general authoring capabilities and features necessary
            to support LIDR and improve the quality of healthcare data. Komet will provide an
            authoring environment that can represent a wide range of healthcare systems and
            terminology standards that also supports exporting data in a FHIR format to map
            laboratory devices, tools, and results to LOINC® and other standards that LISs can use
            to represent new concepts. As part of this initiative, our team plans to perform
            extensive validation exercises at all stages of the workflow to ensure key functionality
            and data quality. This effort aligns with one of LIDR’s goals to reduce the variance in
            device representation across laboratories by automating the mapping process or placing
            the onus of device mapping on the In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) manufacturer, including
            reference and tooling. </para>
