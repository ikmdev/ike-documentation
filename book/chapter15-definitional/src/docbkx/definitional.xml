        <para>We, as humans, are able to express individual concepts and expand on just the name of
            the concept, because we are able to associate certain characteristics to individual
            concepts to further describe itself, as well as establishing connections or
            relationships between concepts. Once concepts have a meaning beyond just a name, and
            have relationships to other meaningful concepts, then reasoning can occur. </para>

I may have missed it but where does the language layer lie within PASTA?  Same question for Definitional layer and any other layers that aren&apos;t shown or related to those layers shown in the PASTA diagram.  If they are sub-layers, can you add them to the diagram?" id="cql_rpc_1hb" flag="done" mid="1"?><?oxy_comment_start author="erhwang" timestamp="20190307T083059-0700" comment="This section was written before PASTA became PASTA - old architecture had Language then Definitional layer.

            is to provide necessary vocabulary to express various domains of medicine, the purpose
            of the Definitions are to expand on just a name to go with an idea - single concepts
            with a name by itself adds no value. In other words, a system must be capable of
            capturing not just the words of the concept, but also provide a mechanism to express
            characteristics of that concept (it has the color white [assuming color and white are
            already defined]) and relationships between concepts (it is a beta-blocker).

        <para>Once a system is able to 'digest' the meaning of concepts, it can begin to utilize
            logic to conduct reasoning. In the field of computer science, the study of Description
            Logic is to represent the domain, then using these concepts to specify properties of
            objects and individuals occuring in the domain. Additionally, another feature of
            Description Logic is the capability to conduct reasoning on represented knowledge<footnote>

            be fully immersed in the study of description logic, then an introduction to Solor
            designs to allow for a robust representation and relationships of concepts, followed by
            topics or concerns from Solor developers and contributors that necessitate a discussion
            on why these concerns could affect a system to conduct reasoning properly or
            successfully. </para>
